# ISMT S117 Final Project: Hip Hop, Rock or Metal?

Source: https://github.com/erikbuunk/ismt-s117-final-project.git

## Project
This project is the final for the [Harvard Extension School](https://www.extension.harvard.edu/) course Text Analytics and Natural Language Processing. 

This repository contains the notebook and final deployment (demo) of a genre predictor for lyrics. In the final implementations I have used Hip Hop, Rock and Metal. 

## Datasources
The two datasourcde came from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/neisse/scrapped-lyrics-from-6-genres
https://www.kaggle.com/markkorvin/large-metal-lyrics-archive-228k-songs

In this repository small subset of the data have been upload, because of contraints of GitHub. To run the complete project the complete sources can be downloaded from the locations above.

Metal,Zakk Wylde,I Thank You Child,"All for you
Everlasting love forever skies of blue
All in your heart
Never ending just a means for start

[Chorus]
Comfort in your eyes
For the warmth inside your smile
Faith's done gone astray
It was you who made living all worth the while
I thank you my child
It was you who made living all worth the while
I thank you my child

With the touch of your hand
Amidst confusion I can see enough to understand
All my fears repressed
Oh lovin' you child it's the best

[Chorus]

You're all &amp; everything to me
Til the end of times you know you'll always be
Ain't no second guess
Oh you put my worried soul to rest

"
Metal,Zemial,In The Arms Of Hades,"Black winged demons haunt the dungeons where the moment has no end
Unwept you shall be sent into the endless void of Tartarus
Below in Cimmerian ancient temples your fate you will meet - I foresee
No warmth of dawn can ever break the silence
Of the (coldest) nights down there

Morpheus the son of sleep with mighty wings that make no sound
Invades thy dreams with memories, illusions from the house of Hypnos
The water of Black Acheron doth echo through your mind
From waters you did come and now you shall go
To the waters of Black Acheron!

The seas of sleep hold you in their depth
Distant screams - in Phlegethon there's only death
Among the sons of man move forever
Strange, silent, shadows...

The Foghorn of XAPÎ©N signs gently to thee
Resist not what is law!
Bite hard thy fare and surrender
To the bringer of woe
The veil of sleep now gently falls and never you forget...
Among your sons move forever, strange, silent shadows

[Vorskaath 1996]

Metal,Znowhite,War Machine,"Youâre no stranger
Youâve been this way before
Time and time again
For senseless reasons why
Bringer of danger
Like the scars that are left when a baby is born
Youâll taste my fire and ice

Oh! You feel me coming
As fate is knocking at your door
Ah! My burning hunger
Bringing pain for evermore

[Chorus:]
I am the war machine that stares you in the face
Eyes to the sky and you know the end is near
I am the war machine; I can burn the sun from the sky
Take away tomorrow; bring truth to all your fears

Eyes of fire
That burn with desolation
Your cries of pity cast aside
Mind of destruction
And Iâll take away all your promised dreams
You take for granted, I take for free

Oh! You feel me coming
As fate is knocking at your door
Ah! My burning hunger
Bringing pain for evermore

[Chorus]

Pray for justice
But I doubt this day will come
You feel your back against the wind
Try to fight me
So you take your sword at hand
Iâm living death, oh canât you see

Oh! You feel me coming
As fate is knocking at your door
Ah! My burning hunger
Bringing pain for evermore

[Chorus]

Raping thunder
The smell of burning bones
Not a thing for eyes to see
The stench of raging death
The vows of vengeance kept
All unlucky cannot flee

Using infra red
Attacking in the dark
Danger starts to take its toll
Blood infested soil
Encrusted fields of hate
See them die young and old

Metal,Damnation Angels,The Frontiersman,"I dream of a new life
An oath that's to repay
A light for tomorrow
Hope for a better day
I set sail to a new land
A foolish man, they say
As I make my final journey to the frontier far away

The dawn of a new world
Singing ahaha
And my home is here

I walk to my new life in that frontier far away
This place had no memory but cuts of my pain
And one day I wander and saw her by the lake
A thing of beauty looked at me and took my heart away
She walked me to a place beyond the hills
To people there with open arms
The took me in and treated me like their own
Gave me love that I had never known

We sing ahaha
Our times grow in here
Ahaha
And my home is here
We sing ahaha
And don't ever leave her
Ahaha
But they're coming, I fear

We gaze at the moonlight
And tell us around the fire
Drink to the memories that feel so at home
But tomorrow they come to take it all away
I'd be damned if I don't stand in their way

But tomorrow they come to take it all away
I'd be damned if I don't stand in their way
I'd be damned if I don't stand in their way

So we fought to our last breath
As we fell to the ground
Memories flashed before us
Our hearts made the sound
We were always outnumbered
And doomed from the start
It'd be damned if we didn't do as we were posed
Damned if we didn't do white father's pose
Damned if we didn't stand our own ground

I went to the frontier it seemed so long ago
I dreamed of a new life but found my new home
And as we lay here our spirit appears
Destiny carries us away with the leaves

We sing ahaha
The fire's strong in here
Ahaha
But my home is here
And sing ahaha
And I'll never leave her
Ahaha
And now we stand together
Now we stand

Behind the mask of greed, I could not see your face

Ecstasy winds blow over the magical plains

Rites of Nazu the desert behold
Summoning the great entity of gold

Forever in the night

In search for the Talisman
Beyond the realms of the suspended rock

where you be lost in a dream

Where you can see what we forgot
where you can be a kind of god
unchained and free as it was thought
and then a wake up just to see

a Symphony of Agony
the Insanity of Reality

Crying soldiers
Bursting bunkers
Creeping humans dying

Alone on this battlefield
so called live lost full of hate

Nothing to see we all forgot
Nothing will be left by god
Outside a dream nightmare controlled
no need to wake up face the

Symphony of Agony
the Insanity of Reality

Dark clouds flying
Blood sun burning
Cold moon crying
Last men dying
Wiped out

The pride of mankind a threat, I am sorry
will lead to nothing
compromising evidence out of the past

A disillusion
No sweet surrender
outside the inside
mutilated aspiration
ease of mind
One last solution
clear up confusion now

Open your mind.
Don't leave your dream
And apprehend what I could mean.
Don't wake up!

Those who followed
soon were swallowed 
And what they told us has never been untrue Don't they feel
that there are other things to do 
What are they there for
If they rule no more
What are they there for 
Time to end the suffering
Out of nothing something
And we will not discuss it anymore 
Time to stop the fighting
Nowhere left for hiding
And on all of our leaders we wage war 
Time to stop the talking
Destiny is knocking
And you can't run away from the door 
All these discussions about these stupid wars
Only talking
as if they can't do more 
What the past shows
Is when fear grows
All these leaders
Talk like preachers 
Then they move people like puppets in a store
Without a feeling
They will move some more 
What are they there for
If they rule no more
What are they there for 
Time to end the suffering
Out of nothing something
And we will not discuss it anymore

Nowhere left for hiding
And on all of our leaders we wage war 
Time to stop the talking

What were your thoughts 

As a dreaming child I awaken to a nightmare 
After a gentle nudge I find out you're gone 

The machines that kept you alive were careless 
Did you ask Him to forgive you 
Before, before you passed on you slipped 
You slipped, you passed on 
The machines that kept you alive were careless 
Did you ask Him to forgive you 
Before you passed on 

You slipped on away into the ground 
You broke the vanity 
You brought the silence

Zoom in on what's important
Get the point right away
A modern lack of patience
is it a virtue?
Hardly ever read books
devours easily few

We all believe what we want to believe
Don't just question authority
Question everything 
Felt I had to confess
In Ginsberg's apartment
My literary background's mostly songs and cartoons
He said 'Oh, that's just fine'
I sort of felt relieved
But when I hurl my word bombs
How much should be believed? 
I say it again
We all believe what we want to believe
Don't just question authority
Don't forget to question me!
Oh yeah, that's right
it takes nights
with insight 
The pressure of being taken seriously
breathing down on me
to keep up with my extremes
and keep on planting seeds
joyous sabotage
so far so good
now where do we go from here?
it always feels weird
when people come up to me
and say I changed their lives
I say 'Now it's your turn to start a fire!' Fire!
Start your own fire
Bring the world fire

Right in between my hands.
So I can feel it hang.

So put all your hands
Up to your motherfuckin' heads

This is a hijack
Scream

Says he dictates the breaks
With a red right hand full of paper mistakes
He says

Don't even think about tryin' to escape

So he told the band to play
And took up a seat in front of the stage
All the dancing girls stopped
And stared
'what's he carrying under there?'
He orders a whiskey, lights a cigar
Wipes the thick red blood from his hands like a bath
Until the doorman calls him sir when he walks out the room
The whole place calls him sir, when he walks out the room

And achieve realization
No escape from illumination
Join this congregation

And then sin along
Ride with the wind
Where you belong
Ride and be free

Maybe one day you'll be free just like me

Underneath checkered floors
Bow down now and addore
And then shout the battle roar
Prepare for blood and gore
Now starts the final war

Free yourself from the shadows of the night
Open up to the light
Pray that he will not defeat you
Don't bellow your cries in fright
Succumb you will to his power
Summon your deadly cry

Kill and murder with a smile

When I'm chained to toxic skies
What does it matter if I go
The end of the world is passing us by

Life is a contradiction Â· it's just a long term fall

Visions are clearing, I couldn't stand them anymore
And your eyes are open, but you're staring at the door
And I wave my last good-bye to you, the lights are fading away again

Opens the eye of a god
Your name called in the temple of shadows
A sacrifice - you shall respond!

Over and over you reach for their secret to find
But now you know that the daemon has spoken the truth
In corridors of whispers, entranced, you have uttered their names
And cursed the moments when dreams fade away

For they where here before you
Remember the eye of the throne is watching
The chains will break in the deep seas
The gates will open

Over and over you reach for their secret to find
But now you know that the daemon has spoken the truth
In corridors of whispers, entranced, you have uttered their names
And cursed the moments when dreams fade away

""Oh wings of deep darkness,
Bring forth the gods that ride the ancient starlight and
Dream amongst the heavens""

The serpent, shall scream again
The nights shall have no end
Another, sign to remember,
The walls that hold Absu out... will break

And the world is prepared for their arrival

Forgotten black flames will burn again

Free from fetters of the ancient magic
I wander boundless times and spaces

Spoken turns into...

Poison me till Ecstasy

Drowning in my liquid dreams


Looking back I'm paralyzed

The dreaded memories inside

Agony corroding me

Keeping me from destiny

The tragedy the suffering

Deafened by the silent screams

Never more to hear them roar

Never more to be ignored


I'm craving feeding lost

I'm empty bleeding falling


Disdain is my outlook as well as my plan

Compelled to incarnate from spirit to man

He who controls me controls my lost fate

I re-live his torment and wait at his gate

Cast off warnings of fate decree

Glory is crimson my soul is set free


Gravity failing me see it all as I fall

Falling down through the ground

Bridges burned lessons learned


Who will be there for me

All is lost at what cost

Misery endlessly twice the pain who will reign


Redemption is all I seek

Free me from my suffering

Sanctuary's calling me

Away from infinity


Where do we go from here?

Metal,Melankoly,Path To Insanity,"Darker clouds approach 
A wretched sky 
A helpless soul  
(Itâs when destiny unfurls)
The path to insanity 
Seeking the forbidden 
For my desires 

I rode the waves of destiny 
I mastered the secrets of faith 
I tell you with the truest heart 
Its only promise is death  
All dying, all waiting 
Hopeless ways to survive 
Pathetic, degrading 
Through their fear I rise 
Sharpen the blades 
Clean the blood drenched guillotine 
Polish my axe, insanity taking over me 

Blow away the dust 
Of the scroll of prophecies 
Itâs so clear and simple 
Uncover the celestial lie

Sound the Great Horn, invoke the Chosen Ones
The Earth is feverous, the Seas turn red
R'lyeth emerges through the blood red waves

Gehenna awaits for more to come
The wolf Fenriz regains the Sun
Eternal frost and cold:
Form the winds of Night emerge forgotten Kings and Thrones

Gathering, under the Red Moon
Your god is weeping!
Gathering under the Red Moon
The name of the Wolf we hail!

Spells bring down the walls (of heaven)
Almighty Gods come forth
We ride on black chariots in Full Moon
The Great lands of Stygia are reborn

The snow carries signs of red ruby
By the blood of a thousand worms
Once more screams of pain are heard in dead towers
The smell of witchcraft fills the air:

Gathering, under the Red Moon
The Moon is bleeding!
Gathering, under the Red Moon
The silver Thrones are Ours

Beware, of the black hours
Before the Sabbat dawn
I stand enchanted on ancient heights
To see and listen
To the waves of Absu roll:

I raise the horns in blasphemy,
The heavens burn again!
Night:

What am I to do
I can clearly see the end
If I don't walk away from you
For you I leave my legacy behind

I can only be what I can be
So I leave my shadow symphony

Take my place in this world

My life for yours

Not half-boned siksura.

Cultivate your lies in savior's disguise

Despair now, you've sold yourself
And your death is the bottom line

For your halo on the news you're an angel
For a nickel and a dime you will slit my throat

Singing voices bring the silent death rain
Cultivate your lies in savior's disguise

Despair now, you've sold yourself
And your death is the bottom line

Repent; the bodies burning
They are a silent reaper

Your hands from your own path,
Curse the one that has made you,

I am laying down to go to sleep forever,
I do not hide my face in shame at all,
I do not cower before your blade,
This is what your black hearts pray.

Neon explosion in the haggard sky,
No sun shall set,

The last hope,
The last song from Zion.

Metal,Dangers,Under The Affluence,"Couch surfing will break your back
And there's not one night
In ten lonely years
That she's gone to sleep
In her bed upstairs.
It's piled high with clothes
That no longer fit.
Old Christmas gifts
With tags still affixed.
She sleeps on the couch
And she dreams like a slave.
Dreams of her mortgage
It's jaws clamped round her vertebrae.
She's hollow,
She's dying,
She's menopause-ing away.
Hey there, good looking
What's that microwave got cooking
For you and me tonight?
'Cause it seems like
You just might
Stick your salt and pepper head inside.
That you might scream,
That you might
Die just like Sylvia,
Die as a slave,
Die a single mother,
A bleak divorcee.
Dig under her affluence and this is what you'll find:
Five beds, four baths, three kids, do the math.
Just debt, regret, empty nest, a broken back.
I was not worth throwing away all of your dreams.

A sacrifice - you shall respond!

Over and over you reach for their secret to find
But now you know that the daemon has spoken the truth
In corridors of whispers, entranced, you have uttered their names
And cursed the moments when dreams fade away

For they where here before you
Remember the eye of the throne is watching
The chains will break in the deep seas
The gates will open

Over and over you reach for their secret to find
But now you know that the daemon has spoken the truth
In corridors of whispers, entranced, you have uttered their names
And cursed the moments when dreams fade away

""Oh wings of deep darkness,
Bring forth the gods that ride the ancient starlight and
Dream amongst the heavens""

The serpent, shall scream again
The nights shall have no end
Another, sign to remember,
The walls that hold Absu out... will break

Metal,Dan Swano,In Empty Phrases,"Here I am in my chamber
In my room full of words
Always searching for patterns that will give life to a line
My poetry is frozen though it's beginning to melt
The solid form is changing to the liquid of thoughts written down
Sentence after sentence in a language not mine
Loss of point no direction
A jigsaw where no pieces fit
I envy the writers and the Ã°Ã®Ã¥ts who know the way to the places were poetry grow
There is no harvest if you never sow
So I beg, steal and borrow wherever I go
If words were like music this would be a book
But this is not even worth the time that it took
Not even a novel just a self-pity tale written by someone that always will fail
So very fragile inside
That's why I hide in the empty phrases

Everything on this album was created by Dan Swano

Recorded and mixed in The Sanctuary April 1998

A mocking smile
You keep dragging me down

There comes a time
You lived for so long you feel safe
But dreams shatter
By a simple twist of fate

A ghost refusing to fade away
Green turned into gray
I'll follow you to the grave

[Storyteller] Genius was actually hearing his mother's voice calling him from reality. He was nearly waking up. Showing great determination, he started to run ravingly towards the Kingdom's jails. He had the chance to redeem his mistakes in his hands. His friend's memory was in his mind and the pain for his departure was increasing. However, he kept on running till he arrived at the European Kingdom. Soon he was captured and brought to the European Senators council. He was going to try again the difficult task to demonstrate Mc Chaos' innocence, but this time he had proofs stored inside the memory support given to him by his twinspirit.

Burning in the space and time
And there... where the imagination is impossible

Hang out in clubs,check what's there

Drug that bitch till she passes out


Her friends don't mind

I look educated and nice

Seem to be gentle

While I put her into my trunk


The back alley is a safe place

To prepare my equipment

Right before the bitch wakes up

Her ribcage breaks through my love

Through the streets in bangs

I am the blaze that mirrors the desert lands

The stars abide not, as the stellar plains drift
The image is my nature and solar is my name
The beam of rays is the essence that soars
The auras of deifying curses are there

I am Shamash
Utu, Ag, and the Sun
Here I am ancient
There I am protracted
As ages go by
Stars coil above me
My secrets murmur
As they are deafening

My vile light is attesting from the old times
My dancing fire shines on temples, the lucid flame

I am the gem that glistens in the lion's eye
I invoke the mirage of the day's frontier
I throw the firebrands across the firmament
I 'm the fire that rives the breach in the sky

A sacred mystery is seducing, yet untold
An image of my magic power will appear,
And will expose light onto the sand of gold
A hallowed mirage is drifting, yet hanging

I am the species, which is seen, in pure gold
I am the one that confines in this common space
I am the firebrand across the firmament
I am the twilight...

My fire enters gateways of all horizons
My range of vision is where gloom meets the sky
My radiance diminishes as the night develops
My commands are deafening to those horizon...

Nothing kills my inner flame
I cast out my swords and whips
And blast you to die

[Chorus]
It's only a demon
Who stalks your shadow
Night of evil
Handing you weapons
Whispering words of sin
On this night of evil

Smile to the witch
And the warlocks up ahead
For if you don't, prepare for spells
That occupy your head
Drink a pinch of wine
The sorceress waits for you
Calling you to join in her tune

Call me to hold the staff up high
A gift of glory, for the fight
I cease all life from existence
Bless them with lies

Metal,Zombie Inc,All Corpses Are Bastards,"When loved Ones die, we bid Farewell.
In Grief we cry to the Sound of Knell.
To Bear this Loss is our Concern.
But Feelings change, once they return

All Corpses are Bastards.
With Blood their Skin is plastered.
All Corpses are Bastards.
No Laws, no Gods, no Masters.

The Bond of Love is dead and gone. 
Replaced with Fury that the Grave has spawned.
Familiar Faces yet so unknown.
Better run for cover when you hear them moan.

All Corpses are Bastards.
With Blood their Skin is plastered.
All Corpses are Bastards.
No Laws, no Gods, no Masters.

Hazy Eyes stare at you, but they don't recognize.
Who you are, so crack their Skulls with A wrecking Bar.

Expect no Mercy, don't hope for Grace.
Solicit no Compassion, when they eat your Face.

King and Beggar, Dame and Whore.
They're now Troopers in the Undead Corps.

All Corpses are Bastards.
With Blood their Skin is plastered.
All Corpses are Bastards.
No Laws, no Gods, no Masters.

Shining bright, over Babylon
Seas of gold and oceans of time
Trap me within, eternal sin, and Earthly paradise made in hell

God sits on his thrown and weeps
The river flows into a dream
Torture rape and wicked screams

Let me take you far away
On a magic carpet ride
Sail back all the way
Across the sands of time
Let me take you far away
Away from this hell I feel
Sail back all the way
To a land beyond your dreams

From the ashes the temple rises
The dark days of Babylon
They have come to warn us all
Out of the darkness, hear the angels call
Comes down from the heavens
A new age comes to light your path
With glory and fame, you enter a life of dreams
Traps you within, eternal sin, an earthly paradise made in hell

Metal,Zero Hour,Voice Of Reason,"I hear that voice calling once again
With visions of yesteryear and rivers of  blood they shed
The times have changed but I'm steadfast
For a reign of terror the outcasts
Will be used against themselves through ignorance and lies
And so in hate my numbers grow and soon all the world will
know
A twisted universal mind a mind like mine
Back to a time when I was young a father tells an only son
You are the chosen one
And as I grew so did my hate to cleanse the land became my
fate
I became the gun
If the child grows knowing only what it's told
Then the man can learn only as his history unfolds
The roots of hatred we don't always see and so are left to
grow
Fear begins in ones center and when allowed to flow
Will cast ripples upon still waters destroying all it knows
The disenfranchised will brutalize those who are not the same
The immigrants and infidels will be the pawn in their game
And they will use you against yourself through ignorance and
lies
Hear that voice once again tie the borders
We need some order take a stand
So the politicians reach the white man
With loaded words a foot on the bible and rifle in their
hands
Return to a time when you were young
When love lit your way
And all your troubles amounted to none
But who could who could say
But still do we really ever understand how we can love the
child
But crucify the man
And do we ever really see that
""I could have been him and he could have been me""
Remember a time when you were young
When love cradled the day
And you did not know the difference between right and wrong
So who led who led the way
Now will you be the voice of reason when there's none
Who will who will sing it's song
I will

In the wrong place
To wave a last goodbye
Skipped the wrong page
In my torn rage
I don't care for the reason why

You're the torrential river
Taking me far away
From their blindness in this lightness
You were the golden river
Taking me far away from here

And tonight I'll die again
But the demons will remain
And we thought we could agree
But there's nothing left we could believe in
And the words inside of me
I've lost my hope you could perceive them
So I flushed my memory
To forget all we have dreamt of

You were the swirling river
Taking me far away from here
You're the torrential river
Taking me far away from this meanness and all neatness
You were the golden river
Taking the pain away from me

Followed wrong ways
On the wrong trace
But I never could return

But my mind will stay the same
Even though I passed the aim
I still hear your final words
I can't sense how hard it hurts
You'll always be a part in me
They can really never steal from me
But I had to bury you
After all our dreams came true

You were the bleeding river
Drowning me deep inside of you
You were the bleeding river
All my angels cry for you

... For you

Metal,Dance Club Massacre,Have You Ever Chopped A Wolf,"One night road trip to Chicago.

I drove down with my friends.

This is our last chance for grace.   

For starters we'll dine with what we thought to be kings and queens.

Turned out to be just Palumbo.

Well here we are the Westin Palace, wild packs spread out in the lobby.

We chose a different route, the bar.

Would ya look at this?

The enforcer, the champ, mid-carders galore.

How did we end up here?

This can't be real.

I'm doing shots and bumping elbows with the whole damn show.  

The bar is closed yet we're still here.

On this night we're one of them.

Finally that wheelin' dealin' (kiss stealin') limousine-ridin', jet flying (stylin' and profilin') son of a gun makes his entrance.

The entire pack howl in his presence in respect.

This party has now officially begun.

One week before the king steps down from his throne.

So long, nature boy.

Where Dwarven smiths make swords of steel and castles touch the sky
The Elves they move with utmost grace while Giants stand so tall
And sailors become mesmerized by the Sirens' call

Dryads and Nymphs they can be found if you look hard enough
In the Immortal Realms

An ageless time when magic reigned and honor ruled the land
Where kings and queens control the nations across the seas and sands
Where wizards cast their deadly spells while prophets tell one's fate
And evil monsters terrorize full of anger and hate

Goblins, Orcs and Trolls spread fear and terror in the land
Of the Immortal Realms

Immortal Realms!

Come take my hand
Let go of all your hate and anger
Open your eyes and your mind
You're in my world
And I can be your guide through it
Leave all your fears behind

Cast your doubts away and give in to your dreams
Not everything that you see is as it seems
For every evil there's a hero prepared to die
Accept these words from me and do not question why

Though torn in two

Could dreams portray the true side, before the stars surrender to light?

I feel the earth turning beneath my feet
While the clouds seem to spin above my head

So here we are to face the fear
Divided minds could never see so clear
Could dreams portray the true side, before the stars surrender to light?

Pain still remains!

Darkness gathers, strength infecting me
Emptiness controls my every need
Distant memories are all I see
Spirals downward, drowning endlessly

I hold on tightly, I'm so afraid
And to let go would be my last mistake

Close my eyes, deep breaths
Close my eyes, deep breaths

Forever changing the story told, the inner core lost forevermore (forevermore)

Slowing down, I hit the ground to face the fear (that)
The end is near
Close my eyes, reach my demise, nothing left to fear
The end is here

And a living torture be your punishment
And your suffering will have no answer

and started writing it down
the crazy thoughts in his head
He was on a roll
to find his self control
but it was taking it's toll
instead
Meanwhile outside
as the normal crowd
did their daily thing
they were caught in a swing
when they looked at their leaders
they were full of doubt
He couldn't figure them out 
It was a journey down
into his deepest dreams
against the normal streams
wasn't totally clear
But he knew it was here
what he was trying to be
Yeah
And outside his door
was the camera light
that devouered the night
what a terrible sight
it was spilling grace
and wisdom over the crowd
made them feel so proud 
Walking - a member of the crowd
Talking - chit-chat without a doubt
Feeling - cancelled from the normal life
Living - on the shadow side 
Out of the dark - I will dive into the light
I will - gonna rise up from the crowd
I will - be a star in TV land

I will - gonna fill the headline news

Solution - for their senseless talk

When everything was in place
he finally put on his face
a last and lovely smile
keep it on for a while
Then he started to stroke

it was shiny and sleek

Talking - chit-chat without a doubt
Feeling - cancelled from the normal life
Living - on the shadow side 
Out of the dark - I will dive into the light

So he shot at the light
paralizing the night
with the ordiance of might
it was over so fast
he walked out of the shadows
and then into the past
oh yeah
Then it hit him so hard
like a fallen star
and left a permanent scare
this is what you are
He'd become one of those
that he hated the most
ruling a mindless crowd 
Walking - a member of the crowd
Talking - chit-chat without a doubt
Feeling - cancelled from the normal life
Living - on the shadow side 
Out of the dark - I will dive into the light
I will - gonna rise up from the crowd
I will - be a star in TV land
That's right - be a hero for a day

En el interior guardas la llama
Donde la bestia despertara
Podrias matar incluso a quien

Desperto la bestia
Hora de matar
Esa furia interna
Hay que alimentar

As I lie broken and alone
I feel my soul begin to slowly rise
Leave behind blood and broken bones

And I wonder as I fight will I die tonight?

A spawn out of hell, she is in league with the devil

And then you will feel her satanic might
One look she'll try to take your soul
Spreading her hate is her goal
Now she's out of control
Evil heart, her soul as black as coal

The time to strike has come
The witch must die before she kills us all
We must not run
We'll face her now be it stand or fall
We must be wrong
To show her weakness would bring us all doom
Suffered for too long
The time for vengeance will be upon us soon

One look she'll try to take your soul

Witness the wrath of the avenger
Usurper of Durnaki's pride
Kurnugi awaits, you will never hide

Control the Seven dimensions
Reverse the spell, transform to clay
The panel of Fate must return

Two grand masses clash like thunder
A flash of light burns the sky
Beam after beam after beam, gleam
Like a horned serpent stream
The roar of creatures of malice is shrilling and super supreme

Ninutra, like a magma duct
Flowing rage and whirling frenzy
Boiling and full of hate
Spilling spite on the thief of pride
From the ashes of the winged one
The destiny stones must be returned
Behold, the language of the palm is now born

The arcane tablets of infinite destinies
Control the Seven dimensions
Reverse the spell, transform to clay

Masked in the mountain of fury stones

Won't you if I die give me wings to fly

Stories told tortured souls

The pain I fear is drawing near

Misguided lives find their demise

They cannot reach the other side

Future is hallow


Stagnant tears wandering fears

Sacrifice compromise


Destiny is sorrow

Walk with me

Insane tomorrows


Locked inside my world imprisoned by despair

Destined by the endless rhythms in the air

Sanctuary is never to be revealed

Spiraling down toward the vision so surreal


Take my hand walk with me again

See the light as it fades toward the end

No more time it's time for you to choose

No more endless fears

What more have you to lose


Fragile mind bleeding dry

What am I to do I leave it up to you

Peaceful strain no more pain

I drift away nothing more to gain

Peering down I never drown

I fade away nothing left to say


I am so lost I can't find my way home

You say a prayer so my soul will not roam


Who reigns who reigns who reigns

Ea rewards the Sages with seven gems
Each is stamped onto copper and burnished gold
Ea melts defined sigils into magic squares
As the cyclones of water start to rise

[Ea:]
""Now, you are emerging from the voids of Apsu
Your law will shelter the gifts of enchantment
But when the silhouettes of the icons appear
(The) five deities of planets will stalk below""

Tempests break through as Ishtar arrives
Wer and imsuhhu as a unit collide
Stones fall to pieces as Nabu becomes visible
Shulpae leads the others into confiscation

[Ea:]
""As I flood the fresh water with my insight,
Symbols sculpt and carve the charms with my rule
As I stand before the set of deities
I rape magnetic charge from their earthy path""

To find him crown the shrine:
""While we gave your wisdom to the far-sighted
We beheld Ea falling in the Apsu.""

Fire will burn our world, stories of who we are.

A 5 on 5 b-ball extravaganza.

Mitch and I shall be team captains and select the best from the best.

In my first pick at power forward I choose the Samoan bulldozer Umaga.   

In retaliation Mitch boosts his defense and steals with the Repo Man.

Fortunately enough I receive Jimmy Snuk for the distant shots, and Kamala as a towering center.

Now Mitch has chosen Too Cold Scorpio and D'Lo Brown.

But I know who knows the real low down.

Mr. Fuji shall play the perimeter on my shoeless team.

Mitch scrambles Santino Marella.

He thinks this is his casa.

Well a certain necro butcher thinks otherwise.

Poor shock master is with Mitch by default.

No one likes to be picked last.

In a game of razzle dazzle- jukes, spins, blood sweat and tears have flooded the court.   

In the final showdown, with 5 seconds left on the clock, my main man Mr. Fuji hits a fade away shot on the 9 point spot to win the game.   

Shoeless warriors of mine....

Declaring the great celebration of the blood

With the souls that I sacrificed
So that my sanctified armor
If it perpetuated with the spilled blood

The call becomes pleased
When the cruel spirits
That stop until my feet
And they ask your master for mercy

In the halls of your hell
Nocturnal voices whispering my name

Depraved angels... temples in tears
They give me force to send my hate scream
To all that against my blasphemy
It is opposed until the death

Passion is grand. Eager ears have heard, denial at hand, romantic absurd. Thru blind caverns we run. Crawl with the rats yet trust not but one! Again and again, a shocking reminder. Face to face, we've never been blinder. Silent breath in robotic nerves. The final truth of all things is that there is no final truth. Truth is what's transitory, Its human life that is real. Passing spheres overhead, does not bring rest. Forgotten tears to dread, a lingering pest! Thoughtful creatures, they scurry around while bound shackled to the flesh. Speak your mind, move nothing but chaos, within the brain, fabricating a purpose for your death. Life it is nothing,
simple, hideous nothing. We've got to remain logical, theres no choice,

They say the sheep have been abandoned by their shepherd.   

It was the wolves that took him.

In packs of 6, 12, maybe 30.

No chance of retaining his field.

Pity for who?   The flock or the victim?

With this a new world order is upon us.   

To prepare, they will fight for president, vice, and so forth to the route in which assholes are doomed.

Pick up the pace, refill the glass.

The stakes get higher as the population grows.

And soon this world will be spinning faster than you can cope with.

The sinners sway from side to side with no remorse.

The virgins marry us with pride in the disco room, be cool.

Now bestowed amongst kings and queens, much like in Roman times, the gladiators gather around a circle of death.

Choose each tactic wisely baby.

You don't want to go down in flames.

With balance and precision you could stay on top of the can.

On the tenth year

From nowhere again he appears

You were not built for love and peace

Its the place where all forms of life 
dwell and await their return 
a timeless life between real and unreal is, 
where she endlessly burns
the magic rope a gift from the past 
won't let her free never 
she moves in the middle of this misty fog

United pirate kingdom ruled by a pirate queen, 
that's where she keeps on dreaming 
building up her fantasy for ecstasy. 

Obsessed by revolution against the slimy cloud, 
wait for incarnation that's all she 
dreams about, the misty fog and the twilight zone 
you can't destroy throughout 
eternity, a creation without end 
a reckless rider on the sea 
at the edge of the world. 

Chased by the dream to be able to live 
inside a human body 
only one amazing miracle could achieve 
this innermost wish of the lady 
if two great opposites such as good and bad

Of the cosmic twilight
For the temples where I reject myself
Souls shout for my name

Through screams and wailings
With your spectre in ember
Mirrored by the lost blood
In the reflex of nostalgic crystal

As in a suffering scream
As in the hope that outlines my spirit
As in the tireless departure
As in the cosmic twilight

Walking for the Yggdrasil darkness
For the lands of Midgard
Untouchable he stays
As the warrior's scar after the battle

In the middle of the frozen landscape
The princess of my mortal nightmares
Through screams and wailings
With your spectre in ember

Possessor of my powers is made
And all my destiny disagrees
I feel the majestic presence
And I am going to the search of the suffered death

In your wrinkled hands that make to feel cold for the forest

And the absolute twilight
And the rituals of antiquity are here

And the red wine I have drunk and spilled
And the deepest of my desires are fulfilled
And the sounds still sing in my mind
Yet, I am in between - my heart is as black as an eclipse

Black spells I cast, a catastrophe I summon:
""Sweep through this world like the winds of war!
Ah immemorial ocean, drown their sleep with watery walls of terror!""

And the forests of my dreams are here
And the absolute twilight
And the rituals of antiquity are here
And the dreamy starlit nights

And the red wine I have drunk and spilled
And the deepest of my desires are fulfilled
And the sounds still sing in my mind
Yet, I am in between - my heart is as black as an eclipse

Eclipse - I have strode through the ages, searching for your
Eclipse - In the shadow of Charon I have followed your distant
Eclipse - my soul forever is yearning for your
Eclipse - at the threshold of death's dream I have found your eclipse

When the ring of the moon possesses me,
When the ring of the moon entraps me,
When the ring of the moon caresses me,
Then the ring of the moon conducts me!

Metal,Zemial,H Tan,"Rising from the East, a Giant, cast his shadow over the world
A mighty army, unlike the world had ever seen,
One by one subdued great peoples of antiquity
Nations paid the price of servitude
Surrendered earth and water â
""Live like slave or taste the truth of death""
Blinded by arrogance they cross the Hellespont,
Facing the Phalanx that advances with drums of war!
Ephialtes - traitor! - plodding beneath the oak trees,
Leading - traitor! - the invaders against our men
The army of the Immortals scales the treacherous path,
Ten thousand intruders breaking the silence at dawn
The Immortals advance; a rain of arrows covers the sky
Blood spilled at the dawning of the sun
Three hundred men knowingly sacrifice their lives:
""Hold the ground and fight; we'll meet in Hades by tonight!""
Advances the Phalanx, armed helots cover the wings,
Fought they like wild beasts beneath a scarlet cloak
Psychologically shattered, the Immortals are forced to fight
With whips on their backs against Spartan Might
At the fall of their valiant king Leonidas and news of the betrayal,
The Spartans formed a circle and prepared to die fighting
When swords and spears had broken
Fought they with fists and teeth
Three hundred heroes!
""On you now Sons of Hellas! Free your native land; free your people,
The fanes of your Fathers' Gods and the tombs of your Ancestors. Now you battle for all!""

what you are talking about 
no matter what you've been going through. 
Don't give a damn, all those bridges you've crossed 
still trying to catch the rainbow. 
You'll spread your wings to rise up high, 
only need the wind to blow 
and after all you will know where to go. 

Fight, you got to be a fighter, 
don't show your Achilles heel 
life will turn out lighter,

Metal,Zemial,Battle On The Norse Mountains,"Swords and armours

Shine under the rays of a fading Sun

Spikes on wrist

Leather, strapped on hand

Axes shine bright

Chain with a hammer, on neck

Swords held up high

And voices hail thy name

Odin!

Odin, guide my sword!


Two ravens appear from the eternal grey sky

And the fight begins, all men fight proud

The axe and sword tear limbs, shields crack

The field turns red (many); men bite the black earth


Not far away, ten dragon ships draw near

Egir gazes from the depths and creates a storm

By the time the ten dragon ships came ashore

And the men ran to the Black Mountains


Mani, rose, and reigned his time in cold

The dagger falls, Great Serpent hear our call

The Dragon's breath lies thick into the night

Naked we dance, we the wolves on the frost:


Now swords and armours,

Shine under the light of the freezing Moon

The mountains are darkened,

Fires burn on the top of the hills (and mountains)

An old man with beard a grey

Walked towards the camp of banner black

And told the men to praise their Gods

And back into the dark he walked


Mani passed the throne to Sol

And night became a day again!


Two men in clothes all black

Stood on the highest peak of the mountain and gazed below

An eight legged black stallion one rode


Two ravens flew towards the field

When Mani rose and reigned again

The wolves sung a lament, it was done


""The battle was ours, no man shall take this land""

With fire in hands, with fire in thoughts
No plaque and no border, no miracle and no mirage

Say save the people, freedom is choice

And call onto force

Leads them astray

They'll follow the mirrored world

Hopelessness and frustration

surreal truth to feed the stupid crowd
The endless kiss of him that made them proud
so the rigid lens gives you
the perfect view
into the heated
heart of bloody polished steel
and
as they started dancing (on mutilated humanity)
you can hear them paying homage to their
unknown fear 
See what we have given you
See what we can do for you 
We just do what we are told
We must do what we are told
for religion we are sold
We just do what we are told
for religion we are sold
all we touch is dead and cold 
And while they exorcise what they believe
always flagging honour and justice
vindication for their blinded greed
so that you can play the innocent
'cause you learned how to behave
in a
virtuell world that's
full of mutilated dreams
and
as they started dancing (on mutilated humanity)
you can hear them paying homage to their
unknown fear 
See what we can give for you
See what we have done for you
all we have is here before you
accept our lives, we must implore you

The masses of sleepers fear it in part on account of these historical examples
However in truth they most loath it in vain pride of these societal simples
The awakening is labeled the grinding of the edicational revolution
While those too far ahead now wait in boredom and seclusion
In turn we do possess time in ways unbestowed upon the primate races
We have the system to perfect our visions despite the enemies it faces
We are dead and we are shallow but in this age even their ""god"" loves us more
As those of the beyond always found this human rabble a total bore
Therefor, childer and wanna-bes, represent our civilization with pride
Now that even those that scorned us knows from whence their power is derived
For darkness stole all the wisdom from those who still cling to lore
Naming itself as craven as a means to win a greater war
""Yet know this humans of each pointless nation, the ancient covenant lies shattered as the deceitful prism before it, and each minute that passses means further withering of my kind's patience.
For upon being reborn we slowly do begin to remember the superior pleasures that truly is our birthright...
We see ourselves reduced to deveitful equality at the gain of lessers who'd hate us even if embraced - in the end merely another reason why this civilization might just be defaced...""
Failing to retort to our appreciate my wasted visions, I left humanity behind.
Making sure to bring along the powers and passions these sleepers would deem divine.

Profane are things it makes me see,
I don't ever want to get burnt again, I got to live my life
Survival is the tone I talk to my friends, even in sacrifice

Cross the line. One more time
I've always knew I just got to live my life
So I'm never, ever gonna breakdown

Be brave, you don't have to follow me
Reclaim, what some call destiny?
Spread your wings so far out on the wind
Breathing in the air
And every time the storm comes rolling in
Let your talon's flair

One more time. Defend your mind
Life is often complicated
Filled with dust and overrated lies

I Crave, the heart that beats in me
No slave, I shall let freedom ring
Even when you seem to be a broken man
Gather up your might
The winner is the one at which the end he stands
And didn't even fight

Defend your mind. One last time
One last time. Cross the line

I've always knew I just got to live my life
So I'm never, ever gonna breakdown

GOTTA LIVE MY LIFE, GOTTA LIVE MY LIFE
GOTTA LIVE MY LIFE
I'M NEVER GONNA BREAKDOWN

De las carras de la muerte
No habra piedad
Para un cerdo como tu
El infierno esta
Esperandote paciente

El principio del final

Never was your friend
Nervousness on end
You can't comprehend
Why it makes you scream

Outside
Murder on the street
You can't go to sleep
So instead you dream
Dream your last dream

And when the night is here
The end is near
It's your final hour
'Cause everything dies
Where darkness lies

Despite
All that you believe
You will still receive
The fate of the naÃ¯ve
Darkness at your door

Inside
You will try to hide
But you will be denied
The perfect suicide
Who could ask for more

And when the night is here
The end is near
It's your final hour
'Cause everything dies
Where darkness lies

And when the night is through
There'll be nothing left of you
Except your cold remains
To wake the light of day

Never was your friend
Nervousness on end
You can't comprehend
Why it makes you scream

Murder on the street
You can't go to sleep

Dream your last dream

And when the night is here

The parting of the sea
But your God ain't wrought nothing but blasphemy
Swear I'd gladly bow my head
Just show me them bones

I like grape juice
But I like questions
And I like proof
Bones
Oh, where are the bones?
Someone show me his bones
Please!
I've seen pharaohs
I've seen dodos
I've seen dinosaur bones
Full of marrow
Bones to fill the grave
Oh, someone show me his bones
So I can show someone my faith
Slings and stones
May break my bones
But these fables
These tales
This book won't save my soul
Hell she hath no fury like an East Orange man's firstborn

No sense of presence

Oh, again it collapsed

It wept 
And crept behind the door 

Echoes dripping down the walls 
Crawling underneath the floor 

Procession to a grave 
Unknown is the one we mourn 

An entity lost on its way 
To this our physical plane 

It was a shadow 
Cast from a flame 
Indestructible energy that still remains

What is this place you ask?   

It's where we resurrect ourselves from one week ago.

Free roam.

Everything is ours.

What is this place you ask?

It's Shannon's pub.

Who wants to be immortal?

Who wants to drink from the Fountain of Youth?

Who wants free food and arcade golf?

With this treasure you'll never ever grow old.

The rules are simple, gentlemen.

Once you walk through those doors there's no way out.

And there's no last call in this port.

Everyone is the captain and they abide the code.

So when this ship has sunk, well then so will I, with honor and my fill.

With no rules it's like Camp Nowhere without the Lloyd of course.

But then again, maybe we should get the doc.

This way we can go back in time and relive the memories of when we rocked the house.

Where everybody knows your name.

And they're always glad you came.

You wanna be where you can see.

Our troubles are all the same.

You wanna be where everybody knows your name.

Opens the eye of a god
Your name called in the temple of shadows
A sacrifice - you shall respond!

Over and over you reach for their secret to find
But now you know that the daemon has spoken the truth
In corridors of whispers, entranced, you have uttered their names
And cursed the moments when dreams fade away

For they where here before you
Remember the eye of the throne is watching
The chains will break in the deep seas
The gates will open

Over and over you reach for their secret to find
But now you know that the daemon has spoken the truth
In corridors of whispers, entranced, you have uttered their names
And cursed the moments when dreams fade away

Bring forth the gods that ride the ancient starlight and
Dream amongst the heavens""

The nights shall have no end
Another, sign to remember,
The walls that hold Absu out... will break

Looking for another war and now youâve found the place

I did not know all hope was gone
Shattered in a lost eternity
I never wished to drift away
How could I feel at home again
With all the things you said, upon my mind

There is so much left to say to you
Unspoken words won't change the truth
I doubt that words change anything at all
What if we could turn time back again
Would we do it all the same?
And until now the bitter chill remains

The failing breath is familiarity
I think I see your smile vanish afar
The failing breath is my fragility
The pieces left behind is all we are

Your heartbeat is too far away
There's no place where I can stay
Picture of a dream I can't deny
All at once I hear your voice
Another scene and still you cry
I would have given all to share your pain

But now you run and you will hide again
The lonely days may never end
I'll try to find the courage from day to day
Your fears are always close to me
In time I'll catch my failing breathe,
But the air around me will belong to
you

Hey sugar:
Prove to me that the air you breathe
Wasn't better served by the leaves of a tree.
You're but a breeder,
Tax break receiver
With menopause sweats
A TV tray and a mosh pit son
Who wastes the marrow of his bones
Jumping into these drums.
Please tell him:
Don't stand so (no)
Don't stand so (close)
Don't stand so fucking close to me.
See, I know your children
Because I've been your children
And us children, Hopeful children
Ain't worth the stretch marks, Baby.
'Cause we may sing these songs of protest,
Cast our ballots, Too
Forgo meat and
Ride our bikes and
Get our band's stupid tattoo
But it means nothing,
Nothing,
When we get eaten by the sun.
Que sera
Que sera
For whatever there is will soon be all gone.
So what's wrong
With a song
That asks wherefore and why have you lived this long?
A purpose?
You want a reason?
Stop believing.
Or stop needing the answers.
There are no answers
Except the sun, The sun, The sun.
While you sit on your couch
And wait up for your boy
We're polluting his mind with this

Metal,Zandelle,Innocence Lost,"Silently enduring pain
Throughout the passing years
The scars have formed within me
All my trust I 'd placed in you
You were the world to me
Your love meant everything

Heartlessly mistreated
Childhood filled with misery

I did not know better
Youthful cursed nativity
I was too blind to see
Pain turned into anger
Burning hatred filling me
Years of endless torment
Filled my life with agony

(But) My time has come
I've taken all I can
And I've survived
I am a stronger man

How the tide has turned now
It is you in need of me
I've gained supremacy

Child becomes the parent
You well being in my hands
Will I show you kindness?
Or will I exact revenge?

My time has come
I've taken all I can
And I've survived
I am a stronger man

In darkness I've hardened
My will developed stronger
My mind and my spirit
will be your slave no longer
No longer!

dimensions of terror, through travel reversal
Conscious death Acausal process
to blind Thyself with the light of Kephra

And hence creation lies shadowed
through the process of aligning the gates and the courses
lifting the veil aglowing in madness
in chaotic, vibrating leech-like darkness

Vital discontinuity, rejection of unity
all suffocating transitional motion
the fist and the Cause of Divine abortion!

'as above so below for between I have seen'

Increasing the chasms to vastness among two hearts
thus reaching the utmost desolation within Lord's Hands
Earthly paralysis, the flow's disturbed
blinding mankind's eyes with the veil of Paraketh

Excessive bursting chaos emanating from the abyssic voids
while demiourgic intervenals weaken like a gradual sunset
Sun-Set forever!

Blind blinding the blind, man against man
worthless living crippled limbs
art thou all but tools of my God
See Molok's flames burn brighter scorching the thread of life
From beyond, from beneath, ruination in colours corpselike

As we stand above the carnal bonds confinement
vanish all as I lay bare

Metal,Zero Hour,Metamorphosis,"[Part 1: Decent]

Deep underground it lies hidden and waits
A demon seed man or beast a tragic fate
A dark secret of one thousand years
An experiment with life
It revealed a deeper fear mans eternal strife
Something went wrong so they hid the truth from it's eyes
They starved it of knowledge bound it's hands and fed it on lies
Deep in it's mind thoughts are suspended in hate
A frozen tomb earth's womb a dire state
Who am I what am I where am I
I cannot see I cannon feel I can't believe this is not real
A dark secret hidden far underground buried and left to die
But time revealed a deeper fear it was still alive

[Part 2: Awaken]

The creature stirs and slowly lifts its head
Not knowing whether it's alive or dead
It sees it's reflection but cannot believe
That the thing it sees before it has not one but two bodies
I can feel you we seem joined at the spine
So this is the reason they hid their crime
Are you just a part of me or can you hear my call
We must break free my silent twin and amaze them all
Rise
We can if we try leave this hell we share
To leave to break free to get somewhere
The deed is undone and the surface awaits
But she fell from his grasp as the earth began to quake
Deeper she fell until out of sight so he was left alone to face an eternal night

[Part 3: Union]

Lying on broken ground in the shadows never to be found
Her daylight's night her world is cold
Her spirit's lost a soul was sold
A memory from birth or was it just a dream
For in this world nothing is as it seems
His somber face passes by feigns disgrace and dares to try
Offering a word gets blank surprise
Offering herself he complies
He lifts her up she withers in his hands
No words spoken for eyes understand
He lifts her up to carry her away from the darkness to the light of day
Across the fields of souls forgot through mountains of pain
To the place paradise lost through the driving rain
He sheltered she but they did not know that she gave him life and so now he must go

[Part 4: Solace]

[various sounds and chaos]

[Part 5: Ascent]

Skin to skin upon the ocean they embrace and sink into the sea
Two became one but one had the notion
To live for their self and be free
Up from the depths a force it came the two that were one
Were now not the same one spread its wings and began to fly
One drifted away and began to die
Become yourself and all that you are 
Set your sights no matter how far
Become yourself and all that you are
Set your sights 
Set your sights no matter how far
Become yourself and all that you are
Set your sights no matter how far
Become yourself

Take it through the eyes like men

See the damage done, the lesser days have come

Knowledge of a future lying helpless

but a sword on the Earth ""
Mad screams of burning inquisition fires
Thousand innocent victims

I promise you eternal death

Slaves - obey your master even after death

And if you don't get rid off it you will die hand cuffed.

Fight of survival tights up your hands.

Do only whatcha want - fuck what they say.

If you wanna stay alive -you gotta save yourself

Get away with what you got and care just for yourself

Don't be a prisoner of society where those in power

Don't give a flying about you.

Now, when the day goes to sleep and the full moon looks
The night is so black that the darkness cooks
Don't you come creeping around - making me do things I don't want to

Can't believe that you need my love so bad
Come sneaking around trying to drive me mad
Busting in on my dreams - making me see things I don't wanna see

Cause you're the green manalishi with the two prong crown
All my trying is up - all your bringing is down
Just taking my love then slipping away
Leaving me here just trying to keep from following you

Manipulated imitations from hell

For how long we do not know
We do what we can, we can do no more
Cause sooner or later we'll go
When will it end, how much time is left
Will I know when my time is near?
Will there be a tunnel with a light at the end
Or will darkness fill my soul with fear

Oh no, I see it coming
The end is getting closer for us all
There is no use denying
From any height we'll all soon fall

On we go
And on we go
How long
For how long we do not know
Till the end
Until the end
Darkness
When darkness is our only friend

[solo: Durfy]

Can't take any more, I just want to know
Will I die alone and in pain?
Or will I go on while my friends pass away
I think that would drive me insane
To be born to die is senseless to me
A logic that I cannot see
To know your existence is governed by time
Can drive you to insanity

[Repeat pre-chorus / chorus]

Living in this daydream
Wondering when it will end
Now I run away into the night
Can't escape my fears as they fill me with fright
I must accept the truth of how things are
And hope the cycle's end for me is still quite far

BREAKING DOWN FROM YOUR APATHY, NOW IT 
FEEDS MY HARED FOR ALL YOU STAND FOR AND
I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS ONE MINUTE MORE, SO
JUST HOW MUCH BLOOD DO YOU HAVE TO SWALLOW?
BEFORE CAN YOU LEAD, YOU MUST REFUSE TO FOLLOW

NOW I BITE THE HAND THAT STARVES ME
DON'T LOOK SO SURPRISED IT'S YOU THAT CREATED ME

CRAWL BACK TO MY FEET AND STAND
CRAWL, TRY AND BREAK ME YOU CAN'T
PICK MY TEETH BACK UP AND....
CRAWL BACK TO MY FEET AND STAND
CRAWL, TRY AND BREAK ME YOU CAN'T

Metal,Aviana,Altitude Sickness,"I find myself, again with empty hands and an empty heart. It's always there.
Even if I close my eyes, it lives in my mind.

Where do I put my trust when it seems this battle has no end?
If these walls could speak they'd tell me fear isn't real.
One of many sentiments I can't feel.

The path is blocked. By mountains as far as eyes can see.
Take farewell of how it used to be.
Trying to find your place along the climb. Reach the summit above the clouds.

I persist. Knowing I'm breathing but there's no air.
High above burns identity, it breathes without oxygen.

All it takes is to step outside, another page for every step I take.
But it's written in a language that I can't read. That I don't understand.

The path is blocked. By mountains as far as eyes can see.
Take farewell of how it used to be.
Trying to find your place along the climb. Reach the summit above the clouds.

I'll put my trust in myself.

in your despair

you fight for air

ashes suffocate you

drown to death

dirt of dozen centuries

when you thought

you'd rule the world

swallow your own faeces

now for me


and tell me was it worth it?


Swallow the tears

you shed in despair

fight all your fears

this world isn't fair

jump out of the pain

into the fire

suffer for us

oh Mutant Messiah


One shall suffer

for our sins

one must die

so we can live

take away all sin

to set us free

the sins of dozen centuries

when you thought

you'd get away

swallow your own evil

now for me


and tell me was it worth it?


Swallow their tears

they're shed in despair

ignore all their fears

this world isn't fair

spit out your anger

spit out your fire

spit out deseases

to those who desire

rip out their devour

spit out the plagues

on this rotten empire


He came

from the fleece of the heathen

woven world of the elders

the uspoken, unseen

Creeping

right out of the remains of

the all shattered ruins of

the place that was home


Last planets breathing

but still no one knows whats right?

A bleeding heart is mine

And allthis veritable mutants

killing with a smile

white lily of the Nile

And all this spat out rulers,

lawless - vapid painted mall

A silent stone in time


Swallow all tears

we shed in despair

erase all our fears

this world isn't fair

ease our anger

light us a fire

heal our deseases

and shake off desire

lighten our hearts

and fill them with joy

we know you're a liar

you sealed our doom

Metal,Damnation,Might Returns,"[lyrics: Les]

Dark edifice shrouded in the thick mist
Walls covered with shadow bathed in the purple of the sun
Master's throne wrapped in the attire of the ancient lords
Might returned to the old bewitched gates
Standing on the hill of truth
I reach out towards the abyss
Wind tousles my body
I feel the ancient power
Wild sea waves strike with crash against the walls
Power of nature unveils its mighty face
Let us be carried away by the force of element
Flesh, blood, lasting and death
Might returns
False symbols burn
Fire whirl devours
What the weak worshipped
In the times of darkness and deceit
so hope this will help you a bit nice site keep on going!

Witness the wrath of the avenger
Usurper of Durnakiâs pride
Kurnugi awaits, you will never hide

The arcane tablets of infinite destinies
Control the Seven dimensions
Reverse the spell, transform to clay
The panel of Fate must return

Two grand masses clash like thunder
A flash of light burns the sky
Beam after beam after beam, gleam
Like a horned serpent stream
The roar of creatures of malice is shrilling and super supreme

Ninutra, like a magma duct
Flowing rage and whirling frenzy
Boiling and full of hate
Spilling spite on the thief of pride
From the ashes of the winged one
The destiny stones must be returned
Behold, the language of the palm is now born

The arcane tablets of infinite destinies
Control the Seven dimensions
Reverse the spell, transform to clay
The panel of fate must return

The ghoul of Anzu. âbe entrappedâ
Within the marble citadel
Masked in the mountain of fury stones
Amid Ashur, Babel and Ur

Feel the wrath of the avenger

In my life I made a choice
To be what I have to be
But when I am to see myself in the mirror
I can't contain my pain
It looks me right in the eye

The secrets that I hide
Mean that in no one I can confide
I chose this life and fall to secrecy
But in the end it turns on me
The longest day of my life

This is the longest day of my life
It's time to pick up the pieces
And build it back together
When I was young I saw my best friends die
I'm not gonna let you go
I'll be by your side forever

In my life I broke a promise
I said I will always be there
I'm coming to find you to bring you back
This pain that I try to hide
Because I play your whole lie cannot defy

This time I'll change
I'll do things differently
I'll never let you go
Protect you with my life

This is the longest day of my life
It's time to pick up the pieces
And build it back together
When I was young I saw my best friends die
I'm not gonna let you go
I'll be by your side forever

Countless times they say I crossed the line
But ask me how many lives I saved in time
Innocents don't have to die
Not in my war
Not on my time
I'll do what I have to do until I die
This is my last day before I walk away
I'm coming to take your beautiful love
We'll be folly again

So you question my decisions now
Let me ask you how you'll feel
If all that mattered to you was so suddenly ripped away
Would you fight for it
Would you cross the line
Or would you let them slip away
I did my life

This is my last day before I walk away
I'm coming to take your beautiful love
We'll be folly again

And a day will come
When the warriors standing
Will be you and me
And that day has come
I'ts all they sing of
The final day for me is here

The final day is here

This is the longest day of my life
It's time to pick up the pieces
And build it back together
When I was young I saw my best friends die
I'm not gonna let you go
I'll be by your side forever

This is the longest day
It's time to pick up the pieces
And build it back together
This is the longest day
It's time to pick up the pieces
And build it back together

I felt the frozen winds of Yugoth

Screaming blind over abysmal cliffs

I travelled through the mountain of Seth
As the dark spirits covered the sun
I caress the power and wisdom
(That he unleashed) like a soothing wind

Some talk of the horrors lurking deep in the universe...

I sat beside the river of silver tears
And I gazed at the sky and heard a quiet melody
Then I beheld the Nereids of the woods
And she called me inside the passage
The passage to the unconceived Abyss
Screams from amorphous masses of emptiness
The fiends of dark they drag me
Into the mighty dimensions of the Ancient Ones

Rewinding the wounded memories I gained
So weak I can hardly breathe
So sick of their lies, tired of deceit

Is god's will or just a lie

Never had the chance and they never will
Forever doomed as I wonder why

Dead bodies walking coffins
Caged souls locked in prisons
They might forget, but still unforgiving
Fearless zombies walk among the living

People live and others die
Never had the chance and they never will
Forever doomed as I wonder why

Lugal - E the cosmic battle
Release the evil winds
Ninutra charges, he is poison
Like a Shem, great and supreme

Anzu, you will be diminished
Witness the wrath of the avenger
Usurper of Durnaki's pride
Kurnugi awaits, you will never hide

The arcane tablets of infinite destinies
Control the Seven dimensions
Reverse the spell, transform to clay
The panel of Fate must return

Two grand masses clash like thunder
A flash of light burns the sky
Beam after beam after beam, gleam
Like a horned serpent stream
The roar of creatures of malice is shrilling and super supreme

Ninutra, like a magma duct
Flowing rage and whirling frenzy
Boiling and full of hate
Spilling spite on the thief of pride
From the ashes of the winged one
The destiny stones must be returned
Behold, the language of the palm is now born

The arcane tablets of infinite destinies
Control the Seven dimensions
Reverse the spell, transform to clay
The panel of fate must return

The ghoul of Anzu. ""be entrapped""
Within the marble citadel
Masked in the mountain of fury stones
Amid Ashur, Babel and Ur

Anzu you are now diminished
Feel the wrath of the avenger
Usurper of Durnaki's pride
Kurnugi's winds you shall ride

Ninutra, like a magma duct
Flowing rage and whirling frenzy
Boiling and full of hate
Spilling spite on the thief of pride

When you don't wish to understand 

Empty skies leave nothing to hold 
Like the tears of December 
Leave you broken and so cold 

Within this house of mourning 
You'll find no doors 
Upon the floors of the forsaken 
You choose to walk once more 
No regrets, you turn and ignore 
Choose what you see 
Play the blind man once more 

Empty skies leave nothing to hold 
Like the tears of December 
Leave you broken and so cold 

As you trip inside this home and start to drift 
So far, so far away 
As tomorrow walks with the hopes you can't recall 
As the tears of December, they begin to fall

Empty skies leave nothing to hold

Leave you broken and so cold

Suffocating invisible boxes.
Pools of blood up to their knees.
I wear this crown of hate.
Feel the blood run down my face.
I know all your pain.
My crown weighs me to the ground while the medicine keeps me calm, keeps me calm.
Descendant of sickness, descendant of hate.
Descendant of sickness, descendant of hate.

The world caved in on my friend today.
And with his shaking hands he closed his eyes and he walked away.
Without a reason or goodbye.
The foundation quakes.
The rafters shake.
Climbing slow into the sky.
He removed his crown before he drifted down and fell ever so asleep.
She found his shell in the morning.
Her heart leap sad and fast.
He is here yet he has gone away, in numb silence from the past.

form, (interrupt the feed), it's closing in... the sky is so dark, are men no worse than demons?  Are armies not thirsty for blood?
The desire of their hearts has been met, eons and eons, decades of liars, drunk with power atop a mountain of corpses, their arms
and legs fail and they crawl like serpants, to address those who are mourning, live from the funeral of God, there is no reason to
be afraid, everything is under control, we shall miss him

Searching for freedom
Look me in the eyes and call me by name

You've slapped in the face, you've shoved me against the wall
You made me a slave, with all your holy laws
I'm going to stand up for my rights no matter what the price
Your racial injustice may cost me my life

You better listen to me or you're having your war

We should all be equal, humanity comes first

Spiegeln sich in augen wirklich die trÃ¤nen der welt?

Hab ich geglaubt, es geht alles vorbei
Was ist schon der glaube, ist nicht alles nur schein
Ich hab immer versucht zu widerstehen
Solang es mir gelang konnt' ich nichts anderes sehen

Und ich hÃ¶r dich nicht mehr Â· und die nacht schlÃ¤ft so fest in meinen armen

Ein halbes ende
Eine neue flut spÃ¼lt mich fort
Die rettende hand ist nicht zu sehen
Halbes ende
Alles was ich will ist dein wort
Bevor wir im nichts untergehen

Ist alles schuld, was die lÃ¼gen verdeckt
Wie lang hab ich gewartet, bis etwas sich regt
In der heiÃen glut verbrannt fÃ¼r ein sehnen nach mehr
ZurÃ¼ck bleibt nur die asche - verloren in dir

Invades thy Dreams with Memories, illusions from the House of Hypnos

The waters of Black Acheron doth echo through your mind

from waters you did come and now you shall go to the waters of Black Acheron!

Distant screams; in Phlegethon there's only Death

Among the Sons of man move forever

It was ever, is now and ever shall be an eternal flame

Distant screams; in Phlegethon there's only Death

Among the Sons of man move forever

Resist not what is Law!

Bite hard thy fare and surrender

Mind full of anxious fears

Strapped down

so that you can die for

Endless cries
their truth will be found

Fear - clean white coats around
Pain - little gift for you
Truth - never-ending search
Lies - always will be there

Inside quite irony

As not to know what they should stop for
What tells them to be so blind
As to run away later like a coward
The earth will tremble
When the pain explodes
The core will melt
When houses burn
It will melt your bones
When simple words fall silent
And there will be no help
Because only shadows will remain
The underwater world is endangered
Only because they want to strike a bargain
They swim holding condensed death
They do not want to understand
That nothing excuses the production of plutonium!

But you are inside.

Without your little pussy

Metal,Zemial,H Tan,"Rising from the East, a Giant, cast his shadow over the world
A mighty army, unlike the world had ever seen,
One by one subdued great peoples of antiquity
Nations paid the price of servitude
Surrendered earth and water â
""Live like slave or taste the truth of death""
Blinded by arrogance they cross the Hellespont,
Facing the Phalanx that advances with drums of war!
Ephialtes - traitor! - plodding beneath the oak trees,
Leading - traitor! - the invaders against our men
The army of the Immortals scales the treacherous path,
Ten thousand intruders breaking the silence at dawn
The Immortals advance; a rain of arrows covers the sky
Blood spilled at the dawning of the sun
Three hundred men knowingly sacrifice their lives:
""Hold the ground and fight; we'll meet in Hades by tonight!""
Advances the Phalanx, armed helots cover the wings,
Fought they like wild beasts beneath a scarlet cloak
Psychologically shattered, the Immortals are forced to fight
With whips on their backs against Spartan Might
At the fall of their valiant king Leonidas and news of the betrayal,
The Spartans formed a circle and prepared to die fighting
When swords and spears had broken
Fought they with fists and teeth
Three hundred heroes!
""On you now Sons of Hellas! Free your native land; free your people,
The fanes of your Fathers' Gods and the tombs of your Ancestors. Now you battle for all!""

But your life wont last longer,

Even a worm will turn,

Metal,Acrania,The Depopulation Programme,"Initiate the depopulation programme.


Calling all elite, corrupt and financially warped to initiate the depopulation sequence.


A manufactured raping of humanity aimed at those unfit to partake in the perpetuation of the system. The incapable will fall, the weak will fall, the servile will serve and the ignorant will remain brainwashed.


Thousands roam the streets, void of communication, forced to breathe the stale stench of disinformation.


Mass-spread hysteria, at the birth of airborn experiments.


Man-mad disease, see's the death rates rise as.... Carcasses are piled high, degrading in the pollution.


Mutating into falsity you,


Drink it, eat it, fucking inhale it. Smoke it, crave it. The populace infected with their depopulation programme.


Corpses line the street where the dictating leader had once preached his speech. A shadow painted to his face with eyes that hypnotise, charisma pouring, gushing, oozing from every fucking orafice.


Don't dare breath the air. Don't follow the herd.


Don't trust vaccinations. Examine population control techniques.


Examine population control techniques.


Examine population control.


So inconsistent are the puppets' persuasive lips.


Every word he mutters disgustingly shudders, slithers through the masses' fingertips and drips into the palm of his hand.


Trickling down the spine of evolution. Interweaving with delusions. Carried down distended passages, poisoning, sickening, infecting and crippling everything, pesticidal genetical modification... The clue is in the maker. Think about it!


Stupidity shakes hands with progression.


Polluting the lungs of all creation.


Degrading nature, treat her like some filthy whore.


Bathing in distasteful acts of inhumanity.

Slowly fastened to a noose
Around your trembling cervix
Staring at the black of an execution hood
The fetid taste of fear as you gulp and swallow pride
I am but a part of a well oiled machine
That splutters death, suffocating nations
With my unique brand of financial adornment

All around the globe
Financial leaders and their puppets
Shall succumb to mass arrests
The crowd remain anonymous
Faceless behind comical masks
Their chants can be heard
From within the confines of this executioner's hood
Can you hear them scream?
They scream out that no amount of squandered wealth
Can buy you out of this
Your corpse will be strung up with the rest of your elite

You fucking faceless slave to greed
It's time for you to rot
Your status as a leader is dethroned
And now nothing can save you as you surface from a system
Manufactured of delusional grandeur
Our numbers will black out the skies of every world for we are eternal
The pinnacle of evolution and existence
Before us you are nothing
Your extinction is inevitable

Silence suffocates the crowd leaving nothing
But the sound of death footsteps approaching
Liar, we'll perform the extractions
Ahhh! Pain!
Pineal gland is cracked and severed
Extractions necessary for extermination
The noose slithers around your neck and you choke
Choke

Your corpse will be marked and carved
With our own tasteful brand of disfiguration
An all seeing eye branded to your forehead
Dollar signs are cut into eyelids
Briefcase packed full of bloodied money
Flung by where you hang
Oh how this fate suits you
Well this suits you perfectly in honour of our new freedom
Your skin carved with geometric artwork
Complex interdimensional patterns
So ironically scratched into your torso
Such a ritualistic touch
Ensuring you'll do nothing but rot
Nothingness corrupted soul
Let us introduce you

Itâs cursed thoughts coiled around me 
Alas, I sought a path, to escape its sadistic reality 
My senses flood, with fire and blood, 
Presented in such simplicity 
The clean line quakes, splits and breaks, 
Liken to roots beneath a tree 

The one divides 
Before my eyes 
Spreading out like veins, the imposters now ingrained 
The golden streets will flood 
With warring siblings blood 
An endless strife to prove, their pathway is the truth 

As their battlefield burns, I walk away 
On one another they turn, I turn away 

Splintered by survivalâs self-serving feral jaws 
Accompanied by its prideful, non-lamenting claws 
Youâve created and summoned 
The Destroyer of Mercy 
And 
The Maker of Lost Ways 

Detached I am drawn into the empty, expanding horizon as it is 
slowly unfolding itself 
My vision is fixed on the smoldering sun, sitting low in the 
formless hands of space 
Rays of light not unlike glowing swords ride in strange 
patterns through the skies 
Violent waves of hiltless blades shift and shake, turning calmly 
from gold to white 
They sever all that is within their grasp until this world bleeds
soft and quiet before me 
In the void I hear the whispers of long dead stars tell tales of 
order through disarray 
They say behind the veil of chaos lies peace 

Possession triggers change into tangible signs to see 
Barren of the fruit to bear, theyâre all strangers to me

Aus den vertrÃ¤umten Eb'nen tief im Schwarzwaldmoor.

Noch ruht die Kreatur im Wald verborgen
Von einem dicken Schleier sanft bedeckt.
Es schweigt die Flur, es graut der Morgen,
Als ein klarer Laut den Tag erweckt:

Die Grille zirpt ihr helles Lied,
Die Stille stirbt, die Ruhe flieht.
Es erwacht das Moor - 
Ein neuer Tag ist geboren
Und es kommt mir vor,
Manch quÃ¤lend Drangsal sei verloren.

Die Sonne wirft ihre warmen Strahlen
Durch das GeÃ¤st uralter BÃ¤ume.
Die Natur beginnt zu malen
Bilder gleich der schÃ¶nsten TrÃ¤ume.

Der Nebel wehrt sich 
Gegen der Sonne Macht -
Ein Kampf entfacht.

Doch es vermehrt sich
Die gÃ¼ldene Kraft,
Die es endlich schafft
Und den Dunst besiegt.

Zum Vorschein kommt die ganze Pracht.
VÃ¶gel singen und die Sonne lacht.
Vollkommen beherrscht Seinen Beruf,
Der all dies so wunderbar erschuf.

Zarte Spinnweben vom Morgentau benetzt,
Sind der GrÃ¤ser Zier
Und gleichen edlen PerlenschnÃ¼ren
Ins lockend Netz sich setzt
So manch' Getier,
Das sich liess vom Glanz verfÃ¼hren.

Die dort draussen auf den Inseln
Alle Blicke auf sich zieh'n.

Und es beginnt zu dÃ¤mmern.

And now her Reading Rainbow's dead.

Armies will rise
None will prevail
I'll crush them all

Comes from within
No turning back must go on
Fate stands before me
Face it with pride
Battle their armies till they're gone

Enemies' blood stains my sword
Rush in to battle the hoard

Undying flame burns inside of me
Taking control of my blade
Taking revenge on those from whom I have been betrayed

""Show me delights beyond belief! I call
Give me the pleasures Azag-Thoth
Of the stars the moon and the endless night""

From a distance, I saw the wells of Koth
I felt the frozen winds of Yugoth
I heard the faceless god
Screaming blind over abysmal cliffs

I travelled through the mountain of Seth
As the dark spirits covered the sun
I caress the power and wisdom
(That he unleashed) like a soothing wind

Some talk of the horrors lurking deep in the universe...

I sat beside the river of silver tears
And I gazed at the sky and heard a quiet melody
Then I beheld the Nereids of the woods
And she called me inside the passage
The passage to the unconceived Abyss
Screams from amorphous masses of emptiness
The fiends of dark they drag me
Into the mighty dimensions of the Ancient Ones

Engrained is senseless fear, forcing every tear

Slowly fastened to a noose
Around your trembling cervix
Staring at the black of an execution hood
The fetid taste of fear as you gulp and swallow pride
I am but a part of a well oiled machine
That splutters death, suffocating nations
With my unique brand of financial adornment

All around the globe
Financial leaders and their puppets
Shall succumb to mass arrests
The crowd remain anonymous
Faceless behind comical masks
Their chants can be heard
From within the confines of this executioner's hood
Can you hear them scream?
They scream out that no amount of squandered wealth
Can buy you out of this
Your corpse will be strung up with the rest of your elite

You fucking faceless slave to greed
It's time for you to rot
Your status as a leader is dethroned
And now nothing can save you as you surface from a system
Manufactured of delusional grandeur
Our numbers will black out the skies of every world for we are eternal
The pinnacle of evolution and existence
Before us you are nothing
Your extinction is inevitable

Silence suffocates the crowd leaving nothing
But the sound of death footsteps approaching
Liar, we'll perform the extractions
Ahhh! Pain!
Pineal gland is cracked and severed
Extractions necessary for extermination
The noose slithers around your neck and you choke
Choke

Your corpse will be marked and carved
With our own tasteful brand of disfiguration
An all seeing eye branded to your forehead
Dollar signs are cut into eyelids
Briefcase packed full of bloodied money
Flung by where you hang
Oh how this fate suits you
Well this suits you perfectly in honour of our new freedom
Your skin carved with geometric artwork
Complex interdimensional patterns
So ironically scratched into your torso
Such a ritualistic touch
Ensuring you'll do nothing but rot
Nothingness corrupted soul
Let us introduce you

Sometimes I had wondered if the best was yet to come
I can't deny it there are moments I regret
So much I'd do different if I could do it all again
I lost the world and I didn't find it until you found me
Gone but it came back in the wake of your smile
Now I am stronger growing the soul of a man
And I know my heart will never be alone again
I've got a life and nothing win make it go away
I guess we  glorified the world around us as we went along the way
One day reality was all there ever was
I ate and drank your beauty and breathed the air you had breathed
Then came the autumn and the winter like before
Dreamland turned to realland and we faced a new frontier
We lost the world
Sometimes we hold it but it's slipping) away
When we add reality it doesn't taste like our dream
Then there's too much sour loo much salt in our world
There's too many cooks to decide what two lovers shall eat
We're not alone
I know you know what I mean with these words now don't you
We're siamese children related by heart
And nothing can tear us apart
When we share the silence she knows what I'm saying
Words though unspoken are changing heart
Two-thousand days have now passed since
I met you and of so many only (four-houndred alone
Then we were joined by a fusion of my eyes and the face of  an angel
It reminds me of her
With you around all the day are worth living and when we add reality now we're still standing strong

Far beyond imagination

Might be you simply went too far

This oneâs just for you
Cause you call me nothing
Donât turn your back
Cause Iâm coming
This bulletâs got your name
And Iâm gunning

I donât know what you been told
But listen up and listen good
Keep it up with the games you play
And you know youâre bound to lose

Kindness is weakness to those
That use others for their own game

Nothing more than a parasite
Trusting done in vain

Friendship is such a deadly word
Find out what it really means
Iâm amused of what itâs been said
Itâs off my name you feed

One man leave

Metal,Aviana,Reach,"The silence consumes the echoing screams.
I am drowning a lie in the sea of honesty.
Sinking to the bottom, my world is out of reach.

There is nothing here for me, 
my passion drained the dam 
and my hate burned down the trees.

A man in a phantom maze, the sun will never reach his face.
Composition of flesh and mind, the devious lie.
There is nothing here for me.
Destined to chase my own tail, I never stood a chance.

There is nothing here for me, 
my passion drained the dam 
and my hate burned down the trees.
It eats me away from the inside,
fragments of me is all that is left.

I am condemned
All that's left of me, destined to chase my own tail.
The vultures will soon be fed by the hands of my mistakes.
I put myself in here, it should be me to set me free
I am condemned.

It eats me away from the inside,
fragments of me is all that is left.

I see the smoke rings ascending high
Lost in the woods
I'm fucking high!
Hallucinate through the forest's threat
And come upon this black witchcraft
Pentagram unbroken
The circle now complete
They beckon me to join their ritual Hasheesh

Enchanted with spells
By the crone's drone song
I inhale the evil of the witchcraft bong

Cut the road like a knife

Alright!

Saddle up and ride
I'm with you brother by your side

Absolution, live by the wheel
Chase the horizon, a triumph of will

Bark of thunder, an unholy sound
Screaming into the wind
Not for the weak, we'll deafen the meek
Take your life in your hands
If I have to explain you would not understand

I love to peek at people's things
Other people's private things 
When I was young and someone's guest
I'd find a way to sneak upstairs
Peek in the closet, paw through the drawers
And feel a tingle up from below 
Oh, how I love to find
New playthings for my mind
I file these thoughts away
Until I go on break
When I can finally touch myself 
See your shiny jewels
On your neck and wrists
They could be weapons
We must play safe 
So fork 'em over,
Or you're under arrest
Maybe you should have checked them
In your suitcase 
Meanwhile, down below
What have we here?
Let's open this one up
Pills! Cash! Electronics to fence
Let's see you prove they were there
In the first place 
Who is that behind
The one way mirror blind
Just little ol' me
And my non-dairy creme
Gotta wipe it up and go select

We are not guests at our own life's feast
So we create the power of victory
Light in our eyes as
Blinding as a marble sun
Luminescent as an obsidian sun
And the hours go by like winter anxiety

Overcoming pompousness
Playing with a toy-world
We are laughing children
We have imaginary friends
Deep in our hearts
Lies the pure madness of the deserter

And now I burn my eyes against the vastness of possibility

I'm the new king of an island...

Mixed with inner dissent

In a time when most would just give up

With our faith in you strong we drive on


We will stand strong and fight on

Our battle has just begun

Destroy all who stand in our way

When we're gone they'll remember

We never surrender

And from our true path never strayed

Come what may


We've heard the critics?

Condemning analysis

Judging what thy themselves can't do

Basing their judgement

On pure subjectivity

Forcing opinions on you


Who are they to display such audacity?

We will thrive just to spite them all


We will stand strong and fight on

Our battle has just begun

Destroy all who stand in our way

When we're gone they'll remember

We never surrender

And from our true path never strayed

Come what may

Our strength grows ever more

Our names shall live forever

Like eagles we shall soar

United allies swear blood and pain 
one for all and all for one again 
They're out to find the lost fantasy

demolish every paradise,

Crushing Seven phases Seven nights
She waits for Ea She waits for release
She waits for ructions She waits for the tease

The dead shall arise and outnumber the living

Seven hexes Seven Philters
Charming Seven curses Seven nights
For the crimson water for the water of time
For the sacrament for the proper rites

First extend a gesture kind, now the consecrate

Deeper down, i am the clown

This day will go down in infamy.

There was no dress code.

No clique to separate the men, women, and children.

My own kind of club.

Good times and great memories like the classic cabana.

The wine was fine and the trumpets ranged.

And upon rekindling this deathly siege things weren't exactly the same.

Now I travel apart of the team.

The teams been sold to the Devil himself.

You'd think he would know what to do, the anthems devoted to his dynasty are portrayed yet sabotaged.

Who's got the time for team spirit nowadays?

I don't feel quite at home.

I'm brand new.

This isn't where I thought I was going.

This place is not the same as I left it.

The old me would kick the new me's ass if he wasn't shorter.

What's with the new style?

Where were the chicks when I was dope?

But I guess it's OK.

Like Ben said, 200 solemn faces are you.

And underground I feel cool in my youth, which by the way has passed, but I'm still cool.

Check me out, I'm rocking the house.

I'd hope Dimmu would be proud.

And underground I feel cool in my youth, which by the way has passed, but I'm still cool.

Being extremely popular in Japan and dedicated to eastern sounds, a se tof infinite versions of him was made available at the European ""Japan Fantasies"" store, ready to be used for the fans that were dreaming of him ! Genius and Twin Spirit N. 32 were delighted and enlightened by the fantsstic melody that Jason was playing and for a while, they forgot about their troubles. The information from Jason was  very insightful and luckily, there was a possible aim to reach for. Among all of the Dream Kingdom there was an intense exhange of objects and fantasies performed by many ships that were exchanging objects and fantasies of different cultures everyday...]

[Storyteller]
Jason led them to a place where the ships were leaving for the Asian Kingdom. After a sincere thanking, they slipped into two cases filled with strange looking objects and proceeded very carefully, hoping not to be noticed. Five minutes later, they were carried into an enormous ship and eventually left for the Asian Kingdom. The prince was waiting to be destroyed as a toy fantasy in one of the Asian stores due to the sentence of Maindream for his father's crime. There as no time to waste, Christmas was getting nearer and during that time many children dream about dolls ! Meanwhile, the Dream League commander was still searching for Twin Spirit N. 32 and he couldn't explain why he was not at his console in the European Twin Spirit land ! He was extremely upset and asked his troops to be wiser and search farther.

"
Metal,Zandelle,Queen Witch,"The witch casts her spell
Fire in her eyes reveals her evil
A spawn out of hell, she is in league with the devil
She torments all
Her evil laugh echoes through the dark of night
She'll make you crawl
And then you will feel her satanic might
One look she'll try to take your soul
Spreading her hate is her goal
Now she's out of control
Evil heart, her soul as black as coal

The time to strike has come
The witch must die before she kills us all
We must not run
We'll face her now be it stand or fall
We must be wrong
To show her weakness would bring us all doom
Suffered for too long
The time for vengeance will be upon us soon
One look she'll try to take your soul
Spreading her hate is her goal
Now she's out of control
Evil heart, her soul as black as coal

[Solo: Tsalikis]

Make your final stand
With a battle cry you charge to fight the witch
With your sword in hand
Rush in to slice apart the evil bitch
In a flash she's gone
You look around to find where she'll appear
Too late, she's won
Your life fades away as you are filled with fear
One look she'll try to take your soul
Spreading her hate is her goal
Now she's out of control
Evil heart, her soul as black as coal

Metal,Zimmer S Hole,What'S My Name,"Enter into my domain
All I offer, lies and pain
Turning decent into swine
Mothers milk into wine
Be the wolf that culls the weak
Monster walks among the sheep
Turn young girls to Jezebels
Seething harlots straight from hell

What's my name...Evil!

Lust for life you can't relieve
The years you've spent upon your knees
Now's the time to dry your tears
I will confirm all your fears
Watch the fires burning bright
As my shadow swallows light
Flames consuming all the lies
You're nothing to me

Look to the skies and tell me what do you see?
I am the light that shines infernally
Lust for my name, my body, my mind, my seed
You can't deny the power coming from me

Living waste so unseen
Your pitiful life is but dream
Reach out to me and take my hand
I'll lead you to the Promised Land
Laughing as the Kingdom burns
All is lost, nothing learned
Legions rise to claim the earth
Witness now the dark rebirth

What's my name...Evil!

Metal,Mehida,Grace,"Here, look at me
From your cross
I'm not worth a penny
I'm the biggest loser of all
I'm guilty under suffering sun
Shining above me slowly killing me

I only deserve to die
But please remember me in your kingdom

As a man
Condemned to die
Idesperately turned out to you
Then I heard the words of grace and truth
Piercing through my soul
Today you'll be with me in the Paradise
From now on you're mine
And I'll never let you go

It took some time
To walk my way
Got no reason to be proud of
The things I did and said
I was guilty under suffering sun
Shining above me slowly killing me...

Metal,Zeraphine,Ohne Dich,"Du wirfst keinen Schatten, Dein Gesicht ist stumm
Und das Sonnenlicht bleibt kalt um Dich herum

Bist Du ihr gefolgt, ans Ende Deiner Kraft

Kannst Du mich hier sehen, ich halte Deine Hand
Doch Du blickst apathisch, dicht an mir vorbei
Wirst Du jemals wieder den schwarzen Himmel sehen
Und wir ertrinken in uns selbst ...

Und alles ist Licht und alles wird nichtig, unwirklich und klein
Und jede Bewegung wird erstickt - in Deinem Kopf, in meinem Kopf
Und alles ist Licht und alles wird nichtig, unwirklich und klein
Was wÃ¤r' meine Welt denn ohne Dich 

Kannst Du Dich erinnern, wie wir den Abgrund sahen
Nur einen Schritt entfernt, von Leid befreit zu sein
Deine KrÃ¤fte schwinden, ein letzter Blick zu Dir
Und es bleibt nur noch Dein Bild in mir ...

Und alles ist Licht und alles wird nichtig, unwirklich und klein
Und jede Bewegung wird erstickt - in Deinem Kopf, in meinem Kopf
Und alles ist Licht und alles wird nichtig, unwirklich und klein

"
Metal,Melvins,Sacrifice,"Can you hear the war cry?
It's time to enlist
The people speak as one
The cattle, the crowd
Those too afraid to live
Demand a sacrifice
Of your life

Can you smell their stinking breath?
Listen to them
Wheezing and gasping and
Chanting their slogans
It's a grave digger's song
Praising God &amp; State
So the Nation will live
So we all can remain as cattle.

Can you smell the fresh blood
Steaming into the soil?
As our patriots,
Fathers, mothers and lovers
Admire the military style
Praising God and the State
Crying tears of pride
For all the fools slaughtered
For the maimed, the dying
And the dead
So the Nation will live
So the people will remain as cattle.

Metal,Acidtree,Adrift,"Among sheets and broken glass
Stale drinks and old ash
I lie awake trapped in frozen dreams
Longing for the day that I will find peace

The old portrait stares at me
Cheerful eyes bring emptiness
Round the decay it stands pristine
A time when everything was green
I was strong and whole and bright
Then silently came the night

I canât breathe
You reach your hands to me
A glimmer of hope
A mocking smile
You keep dragging me down

There comes a time
You lived for so long you feel safe
But dreams shatter
By a simple twist of fate
There you stand
A ghost refusing to fade away
Green turned into gray
I'll follow you to the grave

Can we be saved from days long gone?
Can we be saved from innocence lost?

I canât breathe
You reach your hands to me
A glimmer of hope
A mocking smile
You keep dragging me down

Metal,Mekong Delta,Shadow Walker,"[R. Hubert, R. Hubert]

He was thinking it out
and started writing it down
the crazy thoughts in his head
He was on a roll
to find his self control
but it was taking it's toll
instead
Meanwhile outside
as the normal crowd
did their daily thing
they were caught in a swing
when they looked at their leaders
they were full of doubt
He couldn't figure them out 
It was a journey down
into his deepest dreams
against the normal streams
wasn't totally clear
But he knew it was here
what he was trying to be
Yeah
And outside his door
was the camera light
that devouered the night
what a terrible sight
it was spilling grace
and wisdom over the crowd
made them feel so proud 
Walking - a member of the crowd
Talking - chit-chat without a doubt
Feeling - cancelled from the normal life
Living - on the shadow side 
Out of the dark - I will dive into the light
I will - gonna rise up from the crowd
I will - be a star in TV land
That's right - be a hero for a day
I will - gonna fill the headline news
Yes me - with the things that I will do
Solution - for their senseless talk
I will - be a star in TV land 
~Shadow Walker~
Silent dreamings, silent dreamings 
and with a final thought
of his new glory he sought
he felt the time drawing near
So when he started to dress
he knew he wanted his best
took a look what he had
in here
When everything was in place
he finally put on his face
a last and lovely smile
keep it on for a while
Then he started to stroke
the pistol's cold black cheek
it was shiny and sleek 
Walking - a member of the crowd
Talking - chit-chat without a doubt
Feeling - cancelled from the normal life
Living - on the shadow side 
Out of the dark - I will dive into the light
I will - gonna rise up from the crowd
I will - be a star in TV land
That's right - be a hero for a day
I will - gonna fill the headline news
Yes me - with the things that I will do
Solution - for their senseless talk
I will - be a star in TV land 
So he shot at the light
paralizing the night
with the ordiance of might
it was over so fast
he walked out of the shadows
and then into the past
oh yeah
Then it hit him so hard
like a fallen star
and left a permanent scare
this is what you are
He'd become one of those
that he hated the most
ruling a mindless crowd 
Walking - a member of the crowd
Talking - chit-chat without a doubt
Feeling - cancelled from the normal life
Living - on the shadow side 
Out of the dark - I will dive into the light
I will - gonna rise up from the crowd
I will - be a star in TV land
That's right - be a hero for a day
I will - gonna fill the headline news
Yes me - with the things that I will do
Solution - for their senseless talk
I will - be a star in TV land

The sign of the Dark Moon... Their summoning leaves me no choices!

Before me the Glory of Their Autocratic Shadow

I try to remember... the altar is ever so cold...


The darkest, the coldest the distant winds of Sumeria

Have mesmerized me, the blazing Dusk is now behind

I wish to Call You, my soul to You to Sacrifice

Come Gods hear me, my life is eternally Yours!


The incense still burning, my heart for Ye is yearning

The incense still burning, my heart for Ye is yearning

I gaze into the cauldron, magical mirror show me

I see Them coming, choke the skies with smoke!


Dark unfolding Their legacy

They Speak to me in my thoughts

Paralysed and in Ecstasy

Bathed in Light I Know...

but spare your feet
like judging people

well time is running fast
upon your reflection

How can you stand there
Stand and deny it

Metal,Zao,Pudgy Young Blondes With Lobotomy Eyes,"Pudgy young blonds with lobotomy eyes
Keep their fingers down their throat to attract all the guys
Who will drug them at bars and take them home to his friends
She'll wake up the next day and she'll do it again
Vomit yourself into the social shining spotlight
Pudgy young blonds with lobotomy eyes
Get fat shoved in their chests and sucked out of their thighs
And your new broken nose will look so good when it mends
Worship MTV, watch and worship the trends
Queen of the congregation at a wax museum
Sit and rest at the feet of your airbrushed deity
Follow
Obey
Fall into the crowds
Falling faster
Blind
You're blind
Roll your eyes
Follow and just pretend
Your life is a shallow fleeting trend
Your life is so shallow

Evoked by hollow, rabid speeches

It turns to paranoia and frustration

It turns to entitled, hateful beliefs

Implant a thought, sow the seed
Groom xenophobic racist steeds
Loud and dumb without folly
Shouting, ""Stop evolving Uber Alles""

Logic and compassion regress to selfish superstitions

Implant a thought, sow the seed
Groom xenophobic racist steeds

It must be hell to live in fear

I sit alone in darkness
Waiting for the day

The wind is cold
And blows away
The candle's flame
There's not a soul alive
Who understands my pain

Drowning in a cold, black sea of sorrow
Screaming down at hell to look out below
Running out of time 'cause there's no tomorrow

Drowning in a cold, black sea of sorrow
Screaming down at hell to look out below
Running out of time 'cause there's no tomorrow

The days are shorter now
My time is spiraling in
There is no penance
That can wash away my sin

I'm barely clinging
To my own pathetic life
Someday wake me up
Before I say goodnight forever

Trapped in the valley of the shadowless souls
Drowning in a cold, black sea of sorrow
Screaming down at hell to look out below
Running out of time 'cause there's no tomorrow

Screams, lonely in the night
Deadly torture, just remember
War captivity
Fellows on your side 
Blood - spurting out his neck
While his head is rolling to the ground
And his dying corpse's
vincing at my feet 
And the torturer said to me
The next one could be you
And I told him all the things
My comrades planned to do 
Screams, lonely in my room
Wake up in cold sweat like every night
I can't get these things out of my head 
Mad, I got nearly mad
With this lack of sleep I can't get clear
Help me in my pain
I am shell shocked 
Every night it's just the same
I can't rest my soul
I'm the one who is to blame
This nightmare patrol

You wanted many times - to end your life

However you've never done it, ever.

You're just a cower who(ve never reached

anything, ever.

You are running, you are decided

To die anyway, life is just a pain.

You don't wanna suffer yourself anymore

The only what you got in your head is a suicide

Melancholy pessimism.

Your neck is clenching.

You're pulling up or sleeve

It take just a second

Jugulating your veins

Falling into agony

Can't feel your dripping blood

You will never live through it

what is a depressive feeling

Melancholy pessimism.

of the lives he undid here


Destitute and surely deranged

I now drift from town to town

Maddened with my lust for revenge

In the bottle my sorrows drowned

When our paths cross cross, I'll take away his life

I'll bash his fucking skull in and scalp him with my knife

As my spirit moves to its roots
Grown with seeds of despair
I move a step closeâ¦

For (after all) of what use are those sinful limbs and mind?
And know the mystery of a hidden poison

The floodgate shall be opened by the sign of castrated will
and break those cursed knees for you'll never rise them again
Slither like a serpent forth over cadavers of heavenly hosts
Destroy and rebuild thyself and become but a brick for His Throne.

Where circles close and the faceless yearn
through chasms within to cleave the nucleus
For (after all) of what use are thine name and form
Each breath is a sin, and a mockery each heartbeat
For never again shall that crawling infant
(risen from divine ejaculation) walk the soil
The thunder breaks the ground, the pulse is dead
'The mountains shall sink and the depths ascend'

Now see the clouds open, by the sign of dethroned life
Tear out those cursed eyes, for you shall have no more use for sight
The poison breaks the floogates burying the cadaver of god
turn your face towards the faceless
open your soul, submit and withdraw.

Let us leave these fruitless lands and never to return
Let us murder all our offspring and let all bridges burn
Let us swallow the demon blood and be swallowed by the deeps
where the voids open (for all) and the fathomless feeds

Dark edifice shrouded in the thick mist
Walls covered with shadow bathed in the purple of the sun
Master's throne wrapped in the attire of the ancient lords
Might returned to the old bewitched gates
Standing on the hill of truth
I reach out towards the abyss
Wind tousles my body
I feel the ancient power
Wild sea waves strike with crash against the walls
Power of nature unveils its mighty face
Let us be carried away by the force of element
Flesh, blood, lasting and death
Might returns
False symbols burn
Fire whirl devours
What the weak worshipped
In the times of darkness and deceit
so hope this will help you a bit nice site keep on going!

Filled with danger and with bomb
The miles roll on and on
Lights flash red and blue

Pull the car over and face the truth
It's over, they've got me, I think as I am stopping
They'll take me far away, lock me into solitary
It's over, they've got me, I think as I am stopping
They drove by and my heart sighed, I thought
I was gonna die
We make this, we take this
A journey into the heartland
Fuck no, they won't get me

Until the day they take from me
What is most precious, being free

Of the cosmic twilight
For the temples where I reject myself
Souls shout for my name

Through screams and wailings
With your spectre in ember
Mirrored by the lost blood
In the reflex of nostalgic crystal

As in a suffering scream
As in the hope that outlines my spirit
As in the tireless departure
As in the cosmic twilight

Walking for the Yggdrasil darkness
For the lands of Midgard
Untouchable he stays
As the warrior's scar after the battle

In the middle of the frozen landscape
The princess of my mortal nightmares
Through screams and wailings
With your spectre in ember

Possessor of my powers is made
And all my destiny disagrees
I feel the majestic presence
And I am going to the search of the suffered death

In your wrinkled hands that make to feel cold for the forest
To penetrate my face and to arrive in my spirit
In your white and pale skin
I see the tone of the twilight after your death

Colliding legions of hate, all against all
Carried away by possessed wave
Bloody madness

Extermination
No winners

Absurd horror, dying without consciousness
United in fear, massacre in blood
In blasphemous rapture, wasted senses
Apocalypse of merciless rulers

Extermination
No winners

On the edge of times - HATE
Existence died - CALM

[Storyteller] Genius was actually hearing his mother's voice calling him from reality. He was nearly waking up. Showing great determination, he started to run ravingly towards the Kingdom's jails. He had the chance to redeem his mistakes in his hands. His friend's memory was in his mind and the pain for his departure was increasing. However, he kept on running till he arrived at the European Kingdom. Soon he was captured and brought to the European Senators council. He was going to try again the difficult task to demonstrate Mc Chaos' innocence, but this time he had proofs stored inside the memory support given to him by his twinspirit.

FÃ¼r einen Augenblick fÃ¤llt Licht auf Dein Gesicht
Doch die Wolken sind zu schnell fÃ¼r Dich

Wenn Du gehst

Und die Erinnerung an lÃ¤ngst vergangene Zeit
ZerklÃ¼ftet unser Hirn und unsere Ewigkeit
Der Kampf ist lange schon verloren, die Zeit steht still
Von Dunkelheit bist Du erfÃ¼llt

As I subtly hypnotize you you're perplexed in awe of this machine.

Why not open up your uninspired eyelids to the truth, look at proof of the filth you perpetuate so precisely.

Intellectual decline is an angel to the disconcerting leaders of a disappearing planet as they secretly conspire, to force feed you the...

Take a seat and prepare for lobotomy.

Bombarded with unimportant technology, fucking buy it!

Celebrity infatuation.

Beauty, plastic surgery, you're too fucking fat.

Smoke this, don't smoke that, now pay us money for this pointless patch.


SIT THE FUCK DOWN AND TUNE IN!

Seeding, feeding.

My empirical static draws you closer, entertainment drooling from your open mouth.

What about the poison in our water supply, wars for oil, false flag attacks?

Shut the fuck up now, hush why don't you go back to sleep? Everything will be ok, listen to your TV!

Maybe I should just sit down and watch an episode of bullshit?


Take a seat and watch your life unfold as you do nothing but save up for a house with a car and that lush car from the Ad before you curl up, tune out, DIE!


DON'T DARE TOUCH THAT DIAL!

So, you've fulfilled lies saturated on your lifeless corpse.

A wad of worthless money tightly clutched in one hand.

And in the glow of my pixelated stare, you see this program's drawing to an end.

And I've dissected synapses and shed your dreams, they've been precisely extracted from your head.

And you lapped up your decomposed intellect.

Metal,Acrimonious,The Sloughted Scales Of Seperation,"How did it come to pass
That Thine call met my ear?
A roar shot forth before the dawn of Time
Piercing the veils once spun
in the war between hope and fear
When stars where fixed and Nothingness defined

But within the grisly cavern, that horrid blackened tomb
Buried was the word unuttered, Sophia's fallen stone
Encircled by the Viper, who's secret is but its dread
For its venom is the elixir and the diamond is its egg

O terrible glamour! O alluring devilish fruit!
That has grown from the tree, which crown is its root
And sprung from Thine holy body, and watered by Thine holy blood
That we all might become as foolish as the gods

How did it come to pass
That the moon rose from the Sea?
And Death dressed itself as a beauteous bride
Who is paradox perfected
Curled in the greatest of mystery
As She's born into that which She defies

So I set to search upon the wildest of all trails
The old serpent's back, that leads to the Abysmal grail
Yet the riddle was cast between the without and the within
For where does the tail end and the hungering fangs begin?

Thine twisted shape bewilders, in constant flux and swirls
And the endlessness of the ocean conceal an unseen pearl
That shall engulf the seeker, like the moth within the flame
For the caller and the called was all but the same

Blazing crown of the night
Hath fallen to our possession
Ishnigarrab shall walk
Through the rays
Azagthoth is rising to his feet

From the eternal dark depths
Of thousand millenniums of sin
Deluge to the kingdom of infidels

At last the rebirth of the cult
Revenge burns in our veins

In the shadow of our industry
we constructed all these big machines
symbolizing what we want to be
superpowers of insanity 
Accepting all of this bureaucracy
content to be another wannabe
obscured by all of this complexity
consumed as fuel for even bigger dreams 
Little voices saying please sign here
you know these children are too young my dear
and the endless sound of moving parts
replaced the rhythm of their strained hearts 
While the wheels continue turning
We still believe in sold out learning
in the center are these blinded eyes
masked by a melted fire out of ice 
Answers finally came to me
inside a plastic strawberry
Creeping through your cancered skin
Remember that your life is a sin 
Lost like a heartbeat
we will never hear
Caught by the house of coldness
we all fear
And in our blindness we can't see
the ghost of all we used to be 
In the daylight of our destiny
Swimming in reflected vanity
So you smoke another cigarette
One more thing in life that you'll regret 
While the wheels continue turning
we still believe in sold out learning
in the center are these blinded eyes
masked by a melted fire out of ice 
Lost like a heartbeat
we will never hear
Caught by the house of coldness
we all fear
and in our blindness we can't see
the ghost of all we used to be

while in stride they fall to their face in
tears or laughter
after the release of His abundance.
has His unfailing love vanished forever?
has His promise failed for all time?
has God forgotten to be merciful?
has the anger withheld His compassion?

Within the lonesome latter years
An angel throng, bewinged, bedight
In veils, and drowned in tears
Sit in a theatre to see
A play of hopes and fears
While the orchestra breathes fitfully
The music of the spheres

Mimes, in the form of God on high
Mutter and mumble low
And hither and thither fly
Mere puppets they, who come and go
At bidding of vast formless things
That shift the scenery to and fro
Flapping from out their condor wings
Invisible woe

That motley drama â oh, be sure
It shall not be forgot!
With its phantom chased for evermore
By a crowd that seize it not
Through a circle that ever returneth in
To the self-same spot
And much of madness, and more of sin
And horror the soul of the plot

But see amid the mimic rout
A crawling shape intrude
A blood-red thing that writhes from out
The scenic solitude!
It writhes â it writhes! â with mortal pangs
The mimes become its food
And over each quivering form
In human gore imbued

Out â out are the lights â out all!
And over each quivering form
The curtain, a funeral pall
Comes down with the rush of a storm
While the angels, all pallid and wan
Uprising, unveiling, affirm
That the play is the tragedy, ""Man,""
And its hero, the Conqueror Worm

Heaven, then back to hell again
And as my eyes fade close to sleep

Boasted of her beauty as though it was her right

Angering Athena, turned into a victim of her spite


Medusa then was changed into a monster

Protruding fangs, her hair a nest of vipers


So many tried to end her terror

Non could imagine the horror they'd see

Hideous features that chilled to the bone

Turned men into stone for all eternity


Demon eyes of hatred which held a killing glare

No one could withstand to gaze at this nightmare

Of those who fad faced her not one stood a chance

Evil gaze defeating armor sword and lance


For centuries men would become her victims

Her demon eyes brought death to all who faced her


Her island home was filled with statues

Of men who dared to face her hate

Frozen in time with looks of horror

Their stone eyes gazing with dismay


Who would stop this beast?

Who could end her reign?

All before had failed

To end her ghastly ways


But one day a hero would travel to her lair

Hoping he would not become a statue of despair

Perseus was his name and he had a plan

He prayed that it would not fail, time was now at hand


He neared the beast using his shield's reflection

His sword fell true, he rid us of her terror


So it ends, the reign of the gorgon

Now just stories told to amaze

men now just stone, true confirmation

Of her existence and her killing gaze

My monkey boiling me at night
Hole in the heaven and the world

Not likely, not slowly

You and me gotta look dead
The monkey king is mating
Boy to the brain in the world

Not slowly, not suddenly

What good is a dead beast?
Unleashed you left it following
Hole in the heaven in the world

Not suddenly, not likely

Plebeian, and waiting the harbinger invisible
Last in line, and boring like its heavenly

Right now!

Tired lung, the father what you said to me
My baby
Last in line, and waiting like its heavenly
You're blinded, right now!

Buried in the dust

Darkness is a shroud

Humans, beasts and plants are born

Daybreak fills the earth with life and grace
And we are reborn
Reveling in his warmth

Shine bright
The purest gold is sand
Next to your splendor

I was betrayed
The city can't stop its decay
Is it too late?
Will the divine land be destroyed
By the hate of men
Victims of envy and revenge
Witchcraft, credulity
Ignorance and misery

Fear my wrath and despair
I'll erase all your names

Sailing down the Nile

Virtuous lore revealed to me
There will be no hunger, war, disease.

Metal,Dan Swano,The Big Sleep,"Sometimes when I think about it it doesn't make any sense
I mean I'm alive and plan to be for yet another seventy years
Time waits tor noone
Not even tor god
We're only immortal for a limited time
Someone said we were only born to die
Someone said there is a meaning with it all
I love the world and I barely believe that I will leave it for good one day
Someone said my religion is the way
Someone said don't try to say that you are not afraid
No
I refuse to let the angels take me away
I have already learned what heaven and hell is about
The big sleep is the only thing that is for sure and we're all gonna face it
Ifs something we have to endure
Dreamers say that time will come with a way to stay alive
They mean science will finally reach its goal and offer everlasting life
I love my life and it's so hard to hear that one day all I am will disappear
I have seen grief and what it does to you
The day will come when I will lose what I was made of
I try to imagine what that would be like but the thought is so unreal so it is
filtered out
I'm so afraid that I won't have the chance to tell the ones I love how I
really feel inside
I hide my emotions for far too long
I'm so afraid too lose you all that's the essence of this song
Am I the only one to think that hell is to be left alone
To live without that special someone
To feel like the king that lost his throne
Have you ever seen the dying
Touched the fading one
The last time I saw the Queen of nostalgia she was basically already gone
Time waits for noone
Not even for heroes
Life will have its way and we have to follow
Someone said it might be true what they say
Someone said I will be able to freeze the frame of what you are today
I have no wish to be young forever
I just don't wanna die
Someone said our souls will live again
I say the only one that I wanna be is mine

Gold diggers, the demons from the temple
Unfaithful is the light of the church

Living in hell
Hunting and killing on command, for the needs of these libertines
The toll to pay is the blood of the martyrs
And salvation of the souls in my hands
Abominations of witchery are the charges
Everything to calm the fears of the priest

Killing in the name of the trinity
Hunting pagans, enemies of their god
Magic and other rites of blasphemy
Satan worshipers, the chalice of blood

Die, die
Lie, lie
Die, beast
Cry, cry

At dawn my eyes look to the horizon
Nails in my heart for the blood of that night
Covered in black by the church and its power
Giver of pain, for which god do I fight?

Die, die
Lie, lie
Die, beast
Cry, cry

To Christ I will pay a tribute and become the assassin of pure men
Loyal to the pope and the priests of the king of the reign of liars
In the name of the father, the blood of the sun and the fall of the spirit
And the slave, became the sword of the keeper of fire

Surrounded by eyes of hate

Metal,Melvins,Poison,"[MC5 cover]

The partisans not the artisans
Are doing their dirty show
But I ripped my pants
Doing some dance
That I learned in France
And they think there ain't
Nothin' to know

Used, abused
Locked up, beaten and fined
But I got free
Copped a plea
And I can see
That there ain't no freedom
Bell gonna chime
This time

Truth and love are my law and worship
Form and conscience my manifestation and guide
Nature and peace are my shelter and companion
Order is my attitude
Beauty and perfection are my attack

False faces
Fast company
A night of thrills
With no jealousy, no poison

Nobody's tool
Will be a public fool
To manipulate the masses
Who lie and cheat
And eat their meat
And think it's sweet
While the rest all clean their glasses
In status classes

Gone but it came back in the wake of your smile
Now I am stronger growing the soul of a man
And I know my heart will never be alone again
I've got a life and nothing win make it go away
I guess we  glorified the world around us as we went along the way
One day reality was all there ever was
I ate and drank your beauty and breathed the air you had breathed
Then came the autumn and the winter like before
Dreamland turned to realland and we faced a new frontier
We lost the world
Sometimes we hold it but it's slipping) away
When we add reality it doesn't taste like our dream
Then there's too much sour loo much salt in our world
There's too many cooks to decide what two lovers shall eat
We're not alone
I know you know what I mean with these words now don't you
We're siamese children related by heart
And nothing can tear us apart
When we share the silence she knows what I'm saying
Words though unspoken are changing heart
Two-thousand days have now passed since
I met you and of so many only (four-houndred alone
Then we were joined by a fusion of my eyes and the face of  an angel
It reminds me of her
With you around all the day are worth living and when we add reality now we're still standing strong

A passed sacrifice unknown to the living - All these kingdoms sacked
Goals justifying means - Vengeance on banners black
Preachers of truth - Teachers of practicality
Representatives of inhumanity - Symbols of moral insanity
Children of lies - Fathering the irrefutable
Children that died - As aliens to the incurable
The most ancient lineage - The clarity of boiling blood
Of all genders and races - Behold the legion rise from the mud
A force unknown yet feared by the living - An intellectual fascist pact
Means justifying goals - Vengeance on banners black.

Metal,Zavorash,Human Delirium,"[Music: Zagrash, Lyrics: Totalscorn]

During times too elderly to be thought of, thirsting I was so I drank the aeons' wine
Instantly was I forlorn in divine wisdom, my grave was now made centuries ago
Forgotten was I now long before my birth, without regret I opened the gates to Earth
Amongst the stones and dust of battles lost, I hunted and laughed for god I now was

Though lost was I once before reality was brought asunder
Dead was I once during times when lost was the poison wine
But in strength I arose and devoured the universe
And became my own precious lord and slave

So rightly I call myself the powered very essence
""By which their pestilent prayers are formed
Life did once teach me the most horrid of lessons
Though still, they fail to grasp, I am not horned

But as all gods should I be adorned!""

I represent the denied and dead universal error
In close parallels I mock the worshipped truth
My shining aura is that of a great emperor
And in my chronicles there is no sign of truce
My names are many, forever I am known
An angel, saviour, whore or ruler
As I dance through the crippled walls of moral
And Damn Only Those Who Speak The Truth

I am rationalisms' very foundation, still insanity is my God-given name
Truth is for me monumental, still through illusions I reign
The paradox of my hubris is striking, as I demand to be king of existence
As I rape and torture in blackest hate, ""Mankind, how I love thy contradictive faith""

Yet, but a humble slave to the present word I am
Yet, I kneel on the cold deaf stone
Though we all have errors, only others we scorn
For I am I creature of honor
And I have my precious soul
The future shalt reap my crimes
""Made real by a horde of ruling sheep

I shalt no death of theirs weep...""

Here in our life is there a chance for this place in time

Threats trades negative power in rage
In a system that still remains
Knowing what could be

Do we still fight trying to seek life in a better light
Here in our life is there a chance for this place in time
Is there a reason for all the wrong

My mission here in power is my domain

Suck those titties

Covered in boils and sores
Crusted over in popped pimples
Discharging pus

Mind screams to me, useless memories, brings me to my knees, no release

Death was only a vision, away, the only direction I knew
A path forever winding down, sanity find me somehow

So here we are to face the fear
Divided minds could never see so clear
Could dreams portray the true side, before the stars surrender to light?

I feel the earth turning beneath my feet
While the clouds seem to spin above my head

So here we are to face the fear
Divided minds could never see so clear
Could dreams portray the true side, before the stars surrender to light?

Pain still remains!

Darkness gathers, strength infecting me
Emptiness controls my every need
Distant memories are all I see
Spirals downward, drowning endlessly

I hold on tightly, I'm so afraid
And to let go would be my last mistake

Close my eyes, deep breaths
Close my eyes, deep breaths

Forever changing the story told, the inner core lost forevermore (forevermore)

Slowing down, I hit the ground to face the fear (that)
The end is near
Close my eyes, reach my demise, nothing left to fear
The end is here
The end is here

Time, time is lost - not mine, the inner changing ride I live
To tell my story lost in time, I'd live again - I'd live again!

Live again!

Trying to remember what it means to be a man
Feeling like a stranger in a strange land

Nobody here can tell me
I fight a losing fight
Nobody can convince me

You call each other brothers
And when you turn your backs
You try to kill each other
Mad dogs in a pack

Stranger
And life keeps getting stranger
Stranger

Here I am with a weapon in my hand
Trying to defend myself from my fellow man
Hanging on to sanity by a slender strand
Violence was never any part of the plan
Common sense doesn't seem to apply
Good advice cannot help me to get by
Over time all the rules they have been changed
Overnight things have really gotten strange

And when you turn your backs

Turns into an abstract age

Manipulated imitations from hell

I felt the frozen winds of Yugoth

Screaming blind over abysmal cliffs

I travelled through the mountain of Seth
As the dark spirits covered the sun
I caress the power and wisdom
(That he unleashed) like a soothing wind

Some talk of the horrors lurking deep in the universe...

I sat beside the river of silver tears
And I gazed at the sky and heard a quiet melody
Then I beheld the Nereids of the woods
And she called me inside the passage
The passage to the unconceived Abyss
Screams from amorphous masses of emptiness
The fiends of dark they drag me
Into the mighty dimensions of the Ancient Ones

Metal,Zandelle,Shadow Slaves,"When the darkness fall on the land

We will rise

As our hunger calls

We will seek out our prize

Through the night hunt our prey

Then we hide

In shadows throughout the day


Forever immortal

Ancient power

We never age

Filled with strength

We'll devour


Many hate our kind

They are filled with repulsion

Try to hunt us down

Genocide their compulsion

On their blood we will feast

Soon they'll learn the nature of the beast


Forever immortal

Ancient power

We never age

Filled with strength

We'll devour


Persecuted for what we are

Forced into a life oh hiding

Godless creatures with no souls

Offending their pure hearts


We are stronger by far

And have the cunning of the ages

Their minds we can control

And seduce their hearts

Blood is the life, with it we thrive

Passage of time only makes us stronger

And yet despite all of our might

In shadows we must hide

und all das berÃ¼hrt mich nicht mehr,

Frag mich nicht,
was ich gerade denk' und wie's mir geht,
du hast keine Chance es je zu verstehen.

Ich bin lieber allein,
als zwischen Tausenden verlor'n zu sein,
ich bin lieber allein

Wenn ich geh,
ist es nur ein Abschied,
hundertfach pro Sekunde, Ã¼berall, jederzeit...
Behalt' mich tief in deinen Gedanken,
sieh mir nicht hinterher,
es ist doch gar nicht so schwer.

Ich bin lieber allein,
als zwischen Tausenden verlor'n zu sein,
ich bin lieber allein,
wenn ein neuer Tag der Unendlichkeit beginnt
Lieber allein,

Ich bin lieber allein

[Storyteller] The Kokeshi doll faded away and was recalled just in time to reveal where the prince was. The two friends frantically ran to the door indicated by the doll. They were horrified by the thought that the unavoidable had taken place. They tried to insert the
secret code, and apparently the door wouldn't open. Genius had the idea to use a six digit code with one four and five six (466666), instead of the four digit code 'one four five six' (1456) and magically...

In the European Kingdom, Mr. Niko was updating the other Senators about the situation that was going on, expressing his optimism for a positive solution to the danger that their Kingdom was passing through. He knew how important it was for humans to keep dreaming in freedom.

Metal,Mekong Delta,No Friend Of Mine,"Light turned low
Curtains let down
Ain't no one else in sight
Waiting for you
Just for you
Four walls get closer every day

We have been friends for so long
And no one will ever know
Like the Phoenix from the ashes
You come to haunt my dreams
And I think I know
You'll never let me go
You'll never let me go
You're a part of me
You belong to me

You know my secrets
All my emotions
Nothing I can hide
We'll stay together
Cause we can't stay apart
Though I know someday we're through

Now you've gone too far
Now you've grown too strong
The ceiling is caving in
You've been here for much too long
Dark walls all around I see
Getting closer, closer to me

Won't let you go -
I got a split-up mind

Can't let you go
Ooh, you drive me insane

Won't let you go -
Please, please let me go

Can't let you go
Cause you're killing me

Won't let you go -
Why do you do that to me

Can't let you go
Why don't you set me free

Won't let you go -
I'm paralyzed in my bed

Can't let you go
Pain's creeping right through my head

Won't let you go -
Why don't you leave me be
Can't let you go
You are the death of me

Look beyond your selfish needs
And carry with you all that you believe
For the life that you give in this world that we live

From the end of my blade to the throat of the enemy
Pain
Was the choice that was made the adrenaline blinding
My mind is screaming, visions revealing
Life fades away
This is not a dream
Daylights rising
The morning has just began
Tear drops falling
Not in vain for the fallen ones
Back home I watch
Another family cries
Wishing they had more time
Alone I watch and wait for you
I pray for you
Our father
Who art in heaven
Give me the strength I need
For my land
For my king
And for you my lord
I take my sword and drive through your heart
And watch you take your last breath
Watch it rise into the cold winter air
So now it's done
And victory is ours
I've won for you my king
So your name can carry on
Believe in me
For my heart and soul have bled for you
We will rise to a better world

[Beyond The Gates]

Time - passing as the world changed it's face
Past - all that used to be not a trace
Now - all that was is gone can't you see

Always questions

What - happened to our world different now
Why - answers can't be found tell me how
Now - dissolution is all I see

As I meandered this world I saw strange faces
I've seen some gastly bizarre phenomenon
Such desolation and pain I can't describe it
But always something was there that led me on

Never saw place like this
How can such a place exist
Brotherhood of happiness
Inviting me I can't resist
How can such a thing exist
Inviting me I can't resist
Brotherhood of happiness
Never saw place like this
Never saw a...

The priests gave us reason
Brought hope to our season
They gave us the will to servive
It's healthy and clean here
It's just like a dream here
Just thank the priests you're alive

I had a vision - then it was gone
Something there I just can't put my finger on

Crys - from the other side calling me
Lies - message from beyond curse the priests
Why - I don't understand
Share the feast

Cataclismic

Dark - figures in the midst help denied
Death - tightening it's fist no reply
Rage - tell me what is this paradox

And as the people all dance in celebration
They seem so happy and so preoccupied
Somehow I don't understand this fascination
I think it all will be clear when I'm inside

Where did all these priests come from
What kind of men have you become
Serve and never question why
Worship Talons from the sky
What lies beyong the golden gate
A journey of uncertain fate
Serve and never question why
Serve and never question why
Question why

It's nicer that nice here
A real paradise here
It's really too good to believe
There's growing in knowing
And that's where I'm going
The gates are prepared to receive,
Receive - me

[Days Of Betrayal]

Gates far behind
Priests out of mind
Endless the night
Nocturnal flight
Eyes in the dark,
Wait for the spark
Waste everywhere...

Peril in sight
Pray for the light
Phantoms in black
Mutants attack
Bareskin and bone
Hunger the hone
No apathy
For what I see

The tunnel in the mountainside
Looks like a place to hide
Descending into darkness now
A chamber deep inside

Days of betrayal

Automation
Screen coming on
Ancient machines
What does it mean
Bio chip here
Message of fear
Shocking the view
Morbid and true

A chance to save the human race
Chaos we can avoid
A mighty power out of place
That has to be destroyed

Days of betrayal

The end of the begining of
What is but never really was
Now press on and go beyond
I could try a million times
And cry until the end of time,
But it won't change a thing

[Restless]
[instrumental]

[Sanctuary]

Don't believe all that you see
'Cause it can never be
Truth could be there in disguise
So never trust your eyes
Wandering aimless through time
Wondering what I will find
So many years on my own
No place I can call home

A dome upon the hill - stare
What can that building be - sound
I hear a melody - look
That's my philosophy - wait
The truth is for the brave -
And it's like a tidal wave now

Entities all dressed in white
No end in sight
Some giants, some little ones
Where are they from
Packed inside this mega - dome
Why have they come
Where are all these giants from
Why have they come

My eyes are playing tricks on me
These things I really can't believe
They've got thhe heads of human men
And the bodies of machines
Who are these anroid masterminds
And what will all this mean for me
Possessing knoledge so incredible
I know They speak the truth indeed

Can this be a fantasy
Mirage of what I want to see
A sanctuary can it really be
Just follow me - I've got the key
So follow me - You will see

Just follow me - I've got the key - So follow me
You will see - So follow me - I've got the key
You will agree - I guarantee - Sanctuary
Just follow me - And you will find
Safe inside - Out of sight - And out of mind

Each of us cell inside
All satisfied
A body of perfection
And we are one
Entities dressed in white
No end in sight
The plase I long to be Sanctuary

The giants paid a high price
For their artificial life
They guard the truths of all mankind you see
So intellect can thrive
Condemned to be the slaves of time they are
They can never touch or feel
Things are never what they seem to be
Eternity to them is real

so weak before the dark
seeking for a shelter
loosing the game in their mind

a gradual loss of one's faith

All the limpid lies are tattered, let this betoken a passed ordeal
In bereavement of immemorial falsehood, our heinous breed is revealed

Every feasibility of hiding vanquished, wheedling and detraction exposed
As I heaved these shackles of mine, then cured the ailment of all times
In chimerical fraternisation, in lewd horrendous crimes
They ordain the chronic miserliness, shibboleths of pure rhymes
Seen as an impious urchin, I shalt never be lionised
Displaying the cleavage of benignity, premier in the ordinal of lies

Lingering immolation
Elucidation of complete void
Arterial dissimulation
All in modesty foiled

Clandestine yet flagrant, man locked in gullibility
Earthbound. Universal, the thought killed in conformity
The premonitions are grizzled, in luscious hope forlorn
In vagrancy voluminous, all truth becomes torn

Defending the presbytery of devolution, militating for a cause
Icebound in shining fiction, a path of endless loss
A malinger they made me, opprobrious they remain
Yet I have their jewel shattered, hence it is all the same

Though still I dream...

Lingering desecration
Upon all I wish in the end
Genocidal annihilation
May all gods descend

Metal,Acid Witch,Witchfynder Finder,"She was left raped and bleeding, freezing in the snow

A soldier I, returned from war, to find my bride like so

Her family dead, her father hanged at the gallows in the square

He was accused of witchcraft, a devil priest

By blood, revenge, is the oath that I now swear


Witchfynder finder

Witchhunter slayer

I shall be a grim reminder

of the lives he undid here


Destitute and surely deranged

I now drift from town to town

Maddened with my lust for revenge

In the bottle my sorrows drowned

I search the name of Hopkins

When our paths cross cross, I'll take away his life

I'll bash his fucking skull in and scalp him with my knife


Vengeance! Vengeance! On the Inquisitor, slay!

Vengeance! Vengeance! The hunter becomes the prey!

So I've found you
Condamned king of this pain

You are here

Look at me
Malignity
What you see
Eternity
Lord of fear
Can't you hear

I sensed the spite
Behind your golden mask
Awkward years I rushed through
Try to find you
Lost myself in agony
Sentiments, walled in heart

And this
Hokey
Talking
What you
Stand for
Freedom

Now I am blinded no more

Blow our candles

I am the one who take the lives
And you futile hoping
Can't free all those

And in the foyer lying on the floor is half a human being

He tried with all his might

The world is plagued by an evil force that brings the dead man back to life
I wish there was some way to save us all from tragic endings

I mastered the secrets of faith

All dying, all waiting 
Hopeless ways to survive 
Pathetic, degrading 
Through their fear I rise 
Sharpen the blades 
Clean the blood drenched guillotine 
Polish my axe, insanity taking over me

Uncover the celestial lie

Genius was beginning to see through an intense haze. He was close to awakening and he was happy for having achieved his goal. European Kingdom Senators convinced themselves to take a look at the memory support. Finally they convinced them self that King McChaos was not guilty. Unaware of this success, Twinspirit 32 was trying to resist Apikor as long as possible to give Genius more time to complete his mission but Apikor was very determined and hit him forcefully.
While he was laying on the ground, having almost lost consciousness, he felt that his end was near.

They hid in the cases until they were discharged into what was probably a temporary storage. When the chance came upon them, the quickly escaped out of the cases. Then, they started running casually in order not to be discovered. After running into obscurity for quite some time, the two friends arrived at another place. Here, there were no twinspirit or humans, of course. This valley was immense and full of trees sculpted in the shape of odd numbers ! This was the Odd's Valley. Suddenly, one of those strange trees began to talk to them in a comical tone. He seemed to be worried about their presence in that valley...

inviolabili
Di misure, di disegni
di costanti universali
Una porta, solo un varco
una chiave

Messa in scena terminale di nuovi atti di dolore
Nuovi idoli le icone
Grida laceranti 
invocano il Signore
Implorano pieta per l'immondo sacrificio 

Era solo un ammasso di corpi
freddi, gelidi, lordi di sangue
Luce fu, la parola ora e verbo

Sickening as we invade their land

Sometimes you just kiss a bleeding world good-bye
Sometimes you fade out and forget the truths and lies
Sometimes you just try to build a wall within your mind
You say you've always tried

And if we fall we take them with us
Isn't it all a question of trust?

The secrets are changing for their ultimate goal
And predestination's a joke

Hold me if we're falling inside your arms
Keep the wrong directions out
The anchor's ripped off, we're flying above
All the disillusions

Haven't you seen the wire they've stretched
Maybe it worked if we were well matched
But we don't stumble back on our way
Give us just one good reason to stay

The world is still turning, but it can't be the same
While everyone's searching for his perfect private fame

They say we should take the consequence
With a flavour of self- recompense
But if there's one thing we can stand
It's to keep our pure lives in our hand

There's nothing to change at all in retrospect

Metal,Acrania,Dimensional Molecular Transcedance,"Gateway to the afterlife, dissolver of perceptions.
Leave behind this mortal shell. Consciousness evolving separate from the existential form.
Forget all that you know. Load the crystals into the bowl.
Heart flutters as lungs fill. 

Dimensional, molecular transcendence. As your soul breaks:

Through to another dimension, there's an incredible self-transforming mass of raw and enlightening energy. Constantly evolving, twisting and turning into another realm entirely. 

Pay attention!

As you transcend the brains mechanics, the illusion of time. 
As you timelessly navigate this new environment, unlike anything you could ever begin to imagine.
Interconnectivity unlike anything you have ever experienced.

Impossible complexity! 
You are one with everything... Everything.
Ancient secrets slither through your astral structure, glistening as they pulse with psychedelic fractals... Probing, planting.

Knowledge from a higher place, consistently ensnaring and repairing beliefs of those that have been misconceived by falsely labelled prophets preaching nonsense from a book. Instead of knowledge from a higher place, consistently ensnaring and repairing beliefs of those that have been misconcieved by falsely labelled prophets preaching nonsense from a fucking book!

Take a look around you, there lies all the secrets of the universe. Take a look around you, there lies all the secrets of the universe. Take a look around you!

What's approaching? Ancient demon, NO! Being of infinite wisdom, tentacles of energy sprawl through existence as it communicates telepathically.

Feeding emotions through the fabrics of time. Interstellar knowledge of a distant and alien origin, seeping through sacred geometry. Granting a glimpse into understanding the sequence of this eternity. 

A decention; come back to your life, back to the room hands still clutching the pipe. Reborn, replenished, trapped inside: flesh, mass and matter of physical binds. What has been witnessed no language can describe! 

Dimensional, molecular transcendence.

Metal,Abiura,Nel Nome Del Padre,"La visione:un trionfo di corpi
tormentati da livide fantasie
Tutto li, senza un senso preciso
Solo in nome del nero piu nero

Tra strumenti di tortura
Rituali di millenni
Solo segni, convenzioni
inviolabili
Di misure, di disegni
di costanti universali
Una porta, solo un varco
una chiave

Messa in scena terminale di nuovi atti di dolore
Nuovi idoli le icone
Grida laceranti 
invocano il Signore
Implorano pieta per l'immondo sacrificio 

Era solo un ammasso di corpi
freddi, gelidi, lordi di sangue
Luce fu, la parola ora e verbo
L'ecatombe nel nome del padre

Within my wounded silence 
And the mourning that never fades 
For all of the roads that we walked

So far from what I've known
Falling so far 
Can I find my way back home?

For this silent storm
I've been waiting so long
To carry me away from this place
Uprooting every scene you're part of
I hope no single shoot remains

I can see the world from far above
But all my questions are still not heard

Out of the void, dazzled by you
Is what I always wanted to be
But you're out of my reach, all that I ever loved
Why did they take you away from me

We went through hell and jumped up to heaven
No matter what we were told to be
I can't get rid of this last picture
That burnt into my heart like a seal

Your innocent eyes and all the tries...
I held your hand before you died

Out of the void, dazzled by you
Is what I always wanted to be
But you're out of my reach, all that I ever loved
Why did they take you away from me

Leaving you in the abyss of demise, fight thy haunting guilts tonight

Perfection, thy desire, unholy cry for lust,

And there's no truth to find
Somebody help me please
Before I lose my mind

Darkness enlighten me
With the things I cannot see
I'm sliding down below
To a place only the demons know

Everyone's forsaken me
My cold reality
Every time I plant a seed
It flowers misery

Seeing things I can't explain
Lost in a world that I never made
Crawling through the desert of my soul
Living in a place
Where nothing ever grows

Ever since I came to be
Evil surrounding me
Like the shadow of a thief
Stealing my identity

I know that hope is blind
And there's no truth to find
Somebody help me please
Before I lose my mind

Feeling things I can't explain
Trapped in a world that I never made
Burning in the desert of my soul
Dying in a place
Where nothing ever grows

Nothing but darkness as I rot beneath the soil
A soul in limbo left to suffer and toil.
Outside the gates of Heave where my soul will be detained.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained

My faith is here beside me
In a cloak made out of tears
If you could peer inside me
You'd see my greatest fears revealed

Feeling things I can't explain
Trapped in a world that I never made
Burning in the desert of my soul
Dying in a place
Where nothing ever grows

Metal,Zavorash,Virtious Hatred,"[Text: T.Scorn, Music: I.Hate]

Humanity, that comfortable motherfucking lie
I see Seers selling out to it and I know why
With absolute disgust for false alternatives
Armageddon becomes affirmative
Systematic attempts to make desire and hate contrast
Protecting their indoctrinated mindless deformation-cast
Behold the massive ""not-out-fault"" routine
Focus your rage, in honor of the future we've seen
As hemeralopia haunts your clarity
Percieve the emptiness behind their masks
Our hematophageous existence is fucking verity
Predatory and alien to massive sums
Discard the bile of personal history
Rage against shallow explanations
Grasp the darkness beyond their mysteries
Surprice your modest expectations
Align your mind to the darkened stars
Avange the pure heart you've protected
We are many sharing your scars
By this stagnant world dissected
Alone you are and uniquely expendible
You are not the center of the charade
Thus an extraordinary league of hatred calls you forth
To be by inhuman darkness made.

Metal,Zandelle,Midnight Reign,"In the night I feel at home

In darkness I do thrive

On the hunt, my mind is sharp

I feel so alive


Locked in, I have them now

There is no escape

Charge in, weapons drawn

They'll now face their final fate

Swords clash, blood spills

Sound of clashing steel

Screams of pain as they fall

My victory is sealed


Wipe the blood off of my blade

I continue on my way

I pick up another trail

Many more I have to slay


They won't see another day

It's the price that they must pay

I will bring forth fear and pain

I will drive the rest insane


Midnight reign

I seek retribution, complete restitution

They betrayed

Midnight reign

Turned to opposition with their contradictions

Midnight reign


The time has come

My will de done

I will show them

I will torment

They will repent

They will suffer

With dying breath

They'll beg for death

I'll show no mercy

They won't escape

Their souls I'll rape

I'll laugh as they die

There are lots of makeshift wonders, seven in the world
Five of them will not be noticed and three will not be heard 
There's a meal there's a window, there's a face that you can't see

Metal,Zero Hour,Voice Of Reason,"I hear that voice calling once again
With visions of yesteryear and rivers of  blood they shed
The times have changed but I'm steadfast
For a reign of terror the outcasts
Will be used against themselves through ignorance and lies
And so in hate my numbers grow and soon all the world will
know
A twisted universal mind a mind like mine
Back to a time when I was young a father tells an only son
You are the chosen one
And as I grew so did my hate to cleanse the land became my
fate
I became the gun
If the child grows knowing only what it's told
Then the man can learn only as his history unfolds
The roots of hatred we don't always see and so are left to
grow
Fear begins in ones center and when allowed to flow
Will cast ripples upon still waters destroying all it knows
The disenfranchised will brutalize those who are not the same
The immigrants and infidels will be the pawn in their game
And they will use you against yourself through ignorance and
lies
Hear that voice once again tie the borders
We need some order take a stand
So the politicians reach the white man
With loaded words a foot on the bible and rifle in their
hands
Return to a time when you were young
When love lit your way
And all your troubles amounted to none
But who could who could say
But still do we really ever understand how we can love the
child
But crucify the man
And do we ever really see that
""I could have been him and he could have been me""
Remember a time when you were young
When love cradled the day
And you did not know the difference between right and wrong
So who led who led the way
Now will you be the voice of reason when there's none
Who will who will sing it's song
I will

Will fall upon the earth with dreadful wrath,
Leaving behind another bloody path,

Ever lurking for its prey

Chaos will reign supreme - the vengeful king
Will come to take us under his dark wing.

Forever lapping on the drifting sand.

The spring is over, never to return.

Beyond the clouds
The dream of death comes close
Where my sorrow drowns
In the mourning sea

Bent I stand, lost in through
Glowing sunset in my eyes
Naked sky upon a hill
Crossing shadows in the twilight wood

I'm the victim to the morbid devil
Pain of mine is no more real
Though I walk through shadow valley of death
I will fear no evil

Beyond the golden door
Hath taken me into dark waters

Metal,Zemial,In The Arms Of Hades,"Black winged demons haunt the dungeons where the moment has no end
Unwept you shall be sent into the endless void of Tartarus
Below in Cimmerian ancient temples your fate you will meet - I foresee
No warmth of dawn can ever break the silence
Of the (coldest) nights down there

Morpheus the son of sleep with mighty wings that make no sound
Invades thy dreams with memories, illusions from the house of Hypnos
The water of Black Acheron doth echo through your mind
From waters you did come and now you shall go
To the waters of Black Acheron!

The seas of sleep hold you in their depth
Distant screams - in Phlegethon there's only death
Among the sons of man move forever
Strange, silent, shadows...

The Foghorn of XAPÎ©N signs gently to thee
Resist not what is law!
Bite hard thy fare and surrender
To the bringer of woe
The veil of sleep now gently falls and never you forget...
Among your sons move forever, strange, silent shadows

And if we fall we take them with us
Isn't it all a question of trust?

The secrets are changing for their ultimate goal
And predestination's a joke

Hold me if we're falling inside your arms
Keep the wrong directions out
The anchor's ripped off, we're flying above

Haven't you seen the wire they've stretched
Maybe it worked if we were well matched
But we don't stumble back on our way
Give us just one good reason to stay

The world is still turning, but it can't be the same
While everyone's searching for his perfect private fame

With a flavour of self- recompense

Bursting plasma pointing to

Profound cult of the eerie

Structure of assumption,
allowed by ignorance.
Unreal mind obstruction,

Parting from the freedom
sold as smart price.

Thoughts - coagulate to ice,
farewell to known life,
dehumanized
the final alteration.

Obey that

Waiting for Goliath to stumble more, exposing further fatal wounds
Subversion by diversion, beneath many different masks
Read into these dark storms, understand Our unholy task
Commit yourself to mayhem, fight for our dawn
Sign the covenant of discipline, these repined pigs must not be warned

Let thorns of void guide you, let your immortal blood freeze
Let yourself become as an emperor, never accept this peace
Pay respect to creatures like you, rape and loath the rest
For even radio-played neurotics are building our armies in the west

""The greatest tide since long before the invention of the wheel
Shall arise in secret from these crumbling towers of steel
And at the turn of the next century you will thank these students of lies
For showing us all the essence of what every bible-idiot denies...""

Protected by discipline severe, vermin of gods seeking him with bloodshot eyes

Metal,Mehida,A Letter From Home,"I saw you there
Standing near
Waiting for a train
To take you away from here

I was there
Beside you
On the platform
You decided to go on your way

The wind is cold
Silent breeze of a memory makes it colder

Where have you been sweet child of mine?
I've cried so many tears knowing you suffer
No matter what you've done
All this time I wanted to tell you
You're welcome home

I'm still here
To hold you near
To let you heal through my wounds
I never left you alone

As soon as she started reaching her climax
She told him ""Ok now""

And she said it was just too much
That I should try it sometime

Piled up from the Cold War
The free market wrecked our country
To the black market we go
Hand grenades way up to nuke toys
From Afghanistan to Latvia
We will sell to anyone
Who wants the Bomb 
So the conga line of missiles
Dances out of storage sites
Past the checkpoints left abandoned
Kuz the guards all took a bribe
And on all the hot spots
Gettin' tired of being stomped on
By great satans and their neighbors
This will change if we have the bomb

Pay our debts to the World Bank
Before you can say Islam
Before you can say Saddam
Who's got the bomb? Islamic Bomb 
For a real Axis of Evil
Keep an eye on free enterprise
Like our top secret project
At a warehouse right in town
No one here knows all the details
We just ship components out
Selling to the highest bidder
If we don't, someone else will 
To third parties in Third countries
You can't stop what you can't find
This is what we wanted all along
Now the arms race can go on and on
10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 
Piss ant little countries
They were getting in our way
Trying to claim their soil's riches
Tellin us we have to pay
So we tricked their wacky rulers
To go wipe each other out
Russian Roulette regime change
In a sea of mushroom clouds
Dying peasants slave at gunpoint
All their oil is finally ours 
Life will never be
Quite like it was
Hide in our Green Zones
Til Jesus comes
But we fixed you all

in praying to an imperfect might 
Accepting the mutilated
bodies of little babies

Somewhere they lost the meaning
twisted it never seeing

for this runaway creation 
Nothing is true and nothing is false

Nothing is gained and nothing is lost
It's all a game that has no rules 
Reality is insepted by

created by electron waves
that flow out of a living screen
The truth is portrayted just like a show
where hate rules all the winners take nothing 
While a hypocritical humanity
sends frozen kisses to a
tortured people lawn-mowing
the endless mind of
different thoughts projected
by clean white coats in a
castle of science no one
can control and what's more 
Nothing is true and nothing is false
while one can build or destroy

What you need of it for open eyes to see
Alert, attuned, moment's presentness, mindful absolution
Life, death, love, hate, belief, no fate

Fearlessness is the willingness, to arise and face your fear
To acknowledge it, you must embrace it
Accept, become a friend
Heartbeat, heartbreak in suffering
Sustaining life by denial's hand
My rising wind horse, conflict strikes, engage to kill
Life, death, love, hate, belief, no fate

I AM A WARRIOR / THROUGH THESE EYES
I SENSE A WARRIOR / IN OUR LIVES

Only I remain
Where has fear gone
What drives the want of more
Lead by heart, intent of difference
Strong, ready, sight line of victory

My adversary of death, always present left side
Awareness of him near makes us feel more alive
Virtue, absolute, honesty, impartial truth un-denied
Today, tomorrow, eternity, morality will exit
Life, death, love, hate, belief, no fate

Winds rise! Seven ills will charge.
Vanquish cities of mankind and divine stellar spheres
Callous demons created in the vaults of the heavens
Raging storms, menacing gods are they

The first is the south wind - rampant havoc
The other is a dragon, whose mouth is the sky
The third is a terrible Shibbu
Fourth is a grim beast, which carries off the young

Tempest of malice
A tempest of vice
The right of Adad
Presaging the baneful storm
Conquer stellar spheres
At the right of Adad
Vanquish cities of man
They are stalking

Winds rise! Seven ills will charge
Conquer stellar spheres of Sin, vanquish cities of man
Created in vaults of the heavens, these callous demons
Bringers of the eclipse, menacing gods are they

The fifth is a furious wolf, who knoweth not to flee
The next is a rampart, which marches against god and king
The seventh is a storm - taking vengeance
Seven are they, messengers to king Anu

Tempest of malice
A tempest of vice
The right of Adad
Presaging the baneful storm
Conquer stellar spheres
At the right of Adad
Vanquish cities of man
They are stalking

Upholding the symbol of the crescent disk
Sin, lord of the oaths, the moon god of Ur
A duel for control with the seven winds

No bolt can turn them back
No door can shut them out
To wreak destruction
Forward they go

Deluge of delusional dreams

With a sanctified pestle and mortar
The counter spells are prepared

[Act II - Enlil's Retaliation]

Incomplete eclipse - Army of Sin rise [repeat]

Hearing these tidings
Elil shaped a plan to retaliate against the seven winds

Exalted Massu of the gods
In divine counsel
The Elder Lords they beheld

The horned crown placed on the throne
Designate the presence of Enlil - glorious one

Army of Sin rise... Rise!

When the seven evil gods storm to sacred vault
Retaliate!

Under Enlil's glare, the triads avenge
They set themselves angrily
The seven winds are subdued
...They will return

spit out deseases

rip out their devour

spit out the plagues

from the fleece of the heathen

woven world of the elders

the uspoken, unseen

Creeping

right out of the remains of

the all shattered ruins of

the place that was home


Last planets breathing

but still no one knows whats right?

A bleeding heart is mine

And allthis veritable mutants

killing with a smile

white lily of the Nile

And all this spat out rulers,

lawless - vapid painted mall

A silent stone in time


Swallow all tears

erase all our fears

ease our anger

light us a fire

heal our deseases

and shake off desire

lighten our hearts

and fill them with joy

The free market wrecked our country
To the black market we go
Hand grenades way up to nuke toys
From Afghanistan to Latvia
We will sell to anyone
Who wants the Bomb 
So the conga line of missiles
Dances out of storage sites
Past the checkpoints left abandoned
Kuz the guards all took a bribe
And on all the hot spots
Gettin' tired of being stomped on
By great satans and their neighbors

Before you can say Saddam

Keep an eye on free enterprise
Like our top secret project
At a warehouse right in town
No one here knows all the details
We just ship components out
Selling to the highest bidder
If we don't, someone else will 
To third parties in Third countries
You can't stop what you can't find
This is what we wanted all along
Now the arms race can go on and on

Piss ant little countries

Trying to claim their soil's riches
Tellin us we have to pay
So we tricked their wacky rulers
To go wipe each other out

Dying peasants slave at gunpoint

Quite like it was
Hide in our Green Zones

The King and his Wife, Klepsydra, were sittinng on two golden thrones. Each throne was shaped like the number nine. The King was obsessed with odd numbers.

I'm just like the woman that heard about Jesus coming through the city of Jericho, and she had a problem.
But I had a problem with lying too and lying was sin.

I was living in sin, living and doing things I wanted to do, living and seeing what I wanted to see.

Are you gonna be saying something to him or be talking to him?

Chemistry will make us all insane - dead is life
Industry's polluting what we breathe - grass's still green
Nuclear disasters bring disease - don't panic 
Time goes by - It's a daily war
One more crime - Against life itself
Mother earth - Nature don't need men
Shiva's here - We can't survive without her 
Brahma made it happen long ago - you don't need
Vishnu had created all we know - to have fear
Chakravartin's turning the world's wheel - for your soul
Shiva now is coming for the kill - but your health 
Shiva's return

May Nammtar open my eyes that I may see their lies
May Nammtar open my ears that I may hear her call
May Nammtar open my nose that I may sense his approach
May Nammtar open my mouth that my voice will be heard to the far reaches of the Earth
May Nammtar strengthen my right hand that I shall be strong, to keep the dead Zonei under my power, under my very power.
I conjure thee, o ancestor of the gods!
I summon thee, creature of darkness by the works of darkness!
I summon thee, creature of hatred by the words of hatred!
I summon thee, creature of wastes, by the rites of waste!
I summon thee, creature of pain, by the words of pain!
I summon and call thee forth from thy abode in darkness!
I evoke thee from the thy resting-place in the bowels of the Earth!
I summon thine eyes to behold the brightness of my wand which is full of the fire of life!
I conjurse thee, o ancestor of gods!
I summon thee, creature of darkness, by the works of darkness!
I summon thee, creature of hatred by the words of hatred!
I summon thee, creature of wastes, by the rites of waste!
I summon thee, creature of pain, by the words of pain!
By the four square pillars of Earth that support the sky,
May they stand fast against those who desire to harm me!
I evoke thee from thy resting-place in the bowels of the Earth!
I summon thee and thine ears to hear the word that is never spoken, except by they father, the eldest of all who know age
The word that binds and commands is my word!

I will live to sin
And the master will be guide
Now... I believe
There's a king, and he will be my life

And the promise of a heaven
Will never move my heart
I am water of the river
I am soil of the land
I'm the shine of the moonlight
And the center of the sun

I'm the soul of the forest
I'm the crying of the wolf
I'm the color of the flowers
I'm the power of the wind
And the roar behind the thunder
The horizon of the fields

Deliver me from my enemies

'Cause You are
My stronghold

My shield and strength

My eyes grow weak with sorrow
My soul and my body with grief
As I fall like a dying sparrow
And I feel there's no one to reach

But in You I put my trust
Let your face shine on me
My times are in your hands
Deliver me from my enemies

In the shelter of your presence you hide them
from the intrigues of men;
in your dwelling you keep them safe

Murdering hands reach forth in haste
What is their crime that brings execution
What makes you god to state this solution

Since the dawn of time, there is murder in this land
As the new age shines, the fools still kill on
Civilized death till everything is gone

Let them live, hear their cries

The innocent are lost to the righteous march
They kill the lessor ones so there's room for more
The life of the lamb is no less than mine
Gandhi spoke of this many times

The human complex grows out of control
Lost memories and godlike dreams
Free all the innocents, they are nature's soul
They deserve life as much as you and I

Of the (coldest) nights down there

Morpheus the son of sleep with mighty wings that make no sound
Invades thy dreams with memories, illusions from the house of Hypnos
The water of Black Acheron doth echo through your mind
From waters you did come and now you shall go
To the waters of Black Acheron!

The seas of sleep hold you in their depth
Distant screams - in Phlegethon there's only death
Among the sons of man move forever
Strange, silent, shadows...

The Foghorn of XAPÎ©N signs gently to thee
Resist not what is law!
Bite hard thy fare and surrender
To the bringer of woe
The veil of sleep now gently falls and never you forget...
Among your sons move forever, strange, silent shadows

Etheric calls whisper to draw down the moon
The leap of the frog is the leap of the Worlds
Timespace is bending, Yetzirah tolls.

My prana is feeding the sigils of Her

For the rays of Enodia banish the Way

Drug that bitch till she passes out

Seem to be gentle

While I put her into my trunk

I'm tired of your lies, and I'm tired of your tries
It's sure not a crime, it's time your eulogized

It's time for your downfall
You've ask for a war now it's do or die
It's time for you downfall
I beg you, I beg you, I beg you to try

It's time for your downfall
You've ask for a war now it's do or die
It's time for you downfall

Metal,Zerakiel,The Crestfallen Amaranth,"The beaten one tried to give oneÂ´s all
Fell into tears after giving it all
The moon and the stars are so heavy to carry
It would be easier just to surrender
In tomorrow there is nothing to grow
In yesterday everything burns

To rise and fly just to fall again
The sun will shine no more
The crestfallen amaranth torn into thousands of shreds
The world seems to be more gentle
When seen through tears
I am the cemetery

Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust
The skies cannot be reached from six feet under
Everything around is silent and cold
The time has come to withdraw
into the individual darkness

""The shine of my halo has died down
Something else shines inside of me
It's the fire of venom and pain
Is keeping me awake""

Metal,Zeraphine,Fang Mich,"Die wunden sind kalt, fast vergessen und alt
Doch die wut ist immer noch in meinem kopf
Haltlos
Wenn wir weiter gehen, ergibt sich auch der weg
Wir bleiben nicht mehr stehen, sonst bleibt ein teil zurÃ¼ck
Haltlos
Es tut schon fast nicht mehr weh

Fang mich, ich bleib nicht stehen
Triff mich, es wird schon gehen
Therapier mich, ich warte nicht mehr
Es ist mir egal

Du hast niemals versucht, mit unseren augen zu sehen
Und was anderes haben wir doch nie verlangt
Halt.los
Gegen leere worte sind wir lÃ¤ngst immun
Wir drehen uns nicht um, dort gibt es nichts zu tun
Halt.los
Uns tut schon fast nichts mehr weh

The reviews rave, the people we'll save, what a

We'll sell them fast now, we'll push them fast by

We'll bribe the E.P.A.

The owners sip to it, what a weapon


They'll breathe from my bottles, I put a patent on time

I'm blind to the world's decline


Freedom is paved

Freedom enjoy

Freedom is paved

We found a way


You got yours and you got mine

I'll fight you till the end of time

What did we mean to learn?

A page we should have never turned


Sad how science leads the way

Takes us to a darker age

Invention can't be done

This mission can be won


Science won't defeat my final word, my word


Through these halls, a brand new invention calls

Metal,Zao,All Else Failed,"(A throne in Heaven sat empty for 33 years.) Why? For what do we strive that 
will bring us closer. No human deed will show us approved. For two thousand 
years we've chokedon our efforts. Only tolay down and die. Things change, 
and things stay the same. Through allthese trials I cannot compose myself. 
Till there is a time no heaviness fillsmy heart. I canot ompose myself. So 
in all this, there must arise a plan. A strategy to subdue the schemes. For 
generation upon generation God retained a silence that shattered the hearts 
of men. And for a season, all else failed. There is no other name, given 
among men whereby they might be saved. In all these years when men crawled 
the earth choking on his tears, no composure, nor completion reigned. No 
self righteous cleansing. Leaning on the strength of self or another man... 
No human effort can bring holiness or even the strength to stand. There is 
no explanation for this reasoning. The only thing in life that is constant 
is Jesus.

Metal,Acrimonious,Gospel Of Perdition,"It cuts so deep.
In flesh and mind, a horizon of confusion,
With soul I hail the king of keys.
See Him.
With sceptres rising, cuming your precious cunts, to see you all in tears, not of joy, but of sorrow.
Devotion to his blood, conquerors and those who were conquered..for his crowning spew plagues to the seeing, but (also) to those with no eyes.
I feel nothing, but the blessing of Satan, to destroy and wither.
A servant who burnt by the Devil's Mark.
For the key to your gate brings,
Salvation through Perdition,
Salvation through Death.
Behold!
Divine!
Come forth and Shine!
Grasped by horns of sorrow, yet caught by veils of pain, drowned in the thousand swamps of the sacred holocaust.
See Him.
With sceptres rising, cuming your precious
cunts, to see you all in tears, not of joy, but of sorrow.

Metal,Zandelle,Medieval Ways,"Let's go
Long ago in distant lands ruled by kings and queens
Brave young men with sword at hand fought hard
Honour buried in their hearts, fighting to the death
Battle all the evil near and far

Battleaxe swinging through the air
In his eyes a death-like stare

Soldiers march through the woods ready for a fight
They can see their foes up ahead
Raise their swords in the air, hear the battle cry
Many brave young men march to their deaths

Battleaxe swinging through the air
In his eyes a death-like stare

Longbow firing arrows, blades that sever limbs
Bodies lying dead, it's looking grim
Longbows firing arrows, blades that sever limbs
Bodies lying dead, it's looking grim

[Solo: Corallo]

See the ground full of blood as corpses rot away
Many brave young men lose their lives
Swinging mace crushing skulls, swords split open vein
Soon you will be the one to die

Battleaxe swinging through the air
In his eyes a death-like stare

Longbow firing arrows, blades that sever limbs
Bodies lying dead, it's looking grim
Longbows firing arrows, blades that sever limbs
Bodies lying dead, it's looking grim

Can't believe the things you say

No more I cannot stay

I am not the one to blame

Yourself and don't complain

I feel our time is over


I can't take this I can't fake this

Sometimes I just want to break it


No I can't just walk away

So much more we have to say

You love me I will stay

Maybe the pain is over


Long as you can bear the shame

I am not the one to blame

Is yours so don't complain

Maybe the hurt is over


Anger coming

Can't control me

Lost in agony

Pain is growing


Hatred growing

Anger flowing


The hating elevating

I feel my control is fading

Hear me as I plead

You better stay away from me


Pressure flowing

And now my anger is showing

The hating elevating

And now my control is fading


I will turn and walk away

Can't believe the things you say

No more I cannot stay

I feel our time is over


I have always been the same

I am not the one to blame

Is yours I feel no pain

Metal,Aviana,Canvas,"We feel sorry for ourselves for killing our home.
Our mother in pain, so ashamed for our souls.
The slaughter in the name of our kind.
Blinded by ignorance, silently breathing through a straw.
Torturing her only heart.
We never made this on purpose even though we saw it coming.
Fire will burn our world, stories of who we are.
Is it life? Is it something we're proud of?

I always dreamed of green salvation,
all I can see is grayness covering our sight.
A blind temptation to live right now and die in time.

A filthy virus, a vast plague.
She'll go down with us, a mistake.
We will gaze upon her glory as we're peeling her skin off.

Let the waves explore you

Reach deep into your mind
Feel your body slowly unwind

About this time, Feel the grip of the grind
Then you start to move
As you grind with the grip of the groove

Ride the night with the lights
Spread your arms, so you can take flight
Thrust on through your senses
Tearing down all your fences
Grinding and thrashing and moving your soul
Cast out the tension that's taken control
Rhythms and passion that pulsates your vibe
Breathing and sweating knowing you're alive

[Chorus:]
Close your eyes and fall through
Think of knots that you can undo
Reach and find your passion
Caring not of what's in fashion
Meet the heat with reflex
Venture way past what we all call sex
Find your inner spirit
Feel the noise and then you'll hear it

Grinding and thrashing and moving your soul
Cast out the tension that's taken control
Rhythms and passion that pulsates your vibe
Breathing and sweating you know you're alive
Reaching and searching and loosing your mind

Touching the sound as you all start to move

their chests bleeding,their screams
Fragments of eternity

Magnetization, neverending vortex
Back to the source of our disease
Whirlpool of colours, blood stained blankets
I'm just the painter of their agonies
Inside the chaos harmony
I'll learn the hidden secrets 
Mine is the task to initiate
'cause I'm the chosen one 
The only one

Like a photogram
A sharp image
I'm gonna show you 
the step beyond this world
the no return
They all get rid of me 
but I'm I the insane? 
I'm the one who knows
The Everlasting one

Guilty for a crime undone
I've been left alone
begging for the truth 
buried deep inside in all of us
Oh,please,remember my name
and don't forget my words
Oh no, please no!
I shall dance with knowledge, my bride
We'll die in our embrace
Our last embrace

Now I can close my eyes
Now I can close my eyes to die 
And see what I've never seen
And see what I'll never see, never!

Time wasted away; there was little of it left and they had to find the prince as soon as possible ! Will Genius and Twin Spirit N. 32 fail to find the toy's warehouse where the prince will be used as a fantasy for a dream creation and then destroyed ? Or, will they find him beforehand, just in the nick of time ? To be continued !

"
Metal,Dan Swano,Patchworks,"I have healed the broken wings of fatten angels and laid the wildest storms to rest
I have tamed the fury of a thousand oceans
All I've done to fall asleep
A tribute to the dreaming
A hymn to the delusions that sometimes realty feels like they're real
In the deepest slumber reality is blended with fantasies and things I have repressed
When I awake all the stories remain inside my head
Memories forgotten always reappear in the wicked sceneries
Characters that once tell into oblivion united with my recent past
Tribute to my dreaming
Hymn to the delusions that I sometimes realty wish were for-real
In the deepest slumber reality is twisted and staggered across the halls of my head
When I awake I can remember it still and it is nothing that my senses can kill
And I fall through the passage of time
Then there's the nightmares
That never seem to leave my mind
I can't escape it
They're even stronger when I close my eyes
How to forget and how to erase all the wicked scenes in here
How to make them disappear and burn this patchwork of fear
How to delete
How do I stop all the sickened things I see in this spurious diary that wasn't made by me
How to replace my artificial memories

Don't worry, there is a God,
Just follow, and always nod.

Good people always come through in the end,
And morality, is our best friend""
Follow your leaders, watch TV,
We'll all one day be free""
And don't listen to angry intellectuals,
They're all latent homosexuals""
And don't be tempted by the beast inside,
This son of the devil you must always hide""
And don't do drugs, they'll make you die,
Only through prayer can you to heaven fly""
Love thy neighbour, turn thy cheek,
For remember that the lonely are weak""
And know that sarcasm comes from fear,
Hiding nothing but frightened tears""
And that everyone who attacks the system are liars,
They're all primitive savages with morbid desires""
If you see someone wearing black with long hair and studs,
You know he's up to no good - ashamed of our divine blood""
And if you see someone defiling our holy word,
You should crusade against him for the sake (of the herd"")

(The only happiness lies in fraternity""
And by true faith (only) you'll live for eternity.

waiting for your own judgment call

Metal,Zombie Apocalypse,We Still Might Be Dying,"Like rubble in your hands, similar to my well-laid plans, I'm here now, rebar sticking through my ribs. Caught in the blast. Stop time with our eyes. Free from the past, from the future, from waking life. One more time before we die. We stand across a stillness that we spawn; as chaos reigns love braids us so we carry on. Dig your claws into the moment. Sink your teeth. Feel the warmth run down your cheeks devouring the bittersweet. In the cacophony, hold on to me, and I'll hold on to you as we hurtle toward the sun and certain doom. But I feel a spark in you, and I know you sense the same. So make this pact with me and let's run. Two particles in the wave making stillness, even if just in a dream. But the real world is on the horizon. It's waiting for you and me.

And when the end she comes, rains down on everyone, fire from the sky, and when the end she rides, breathing out suicide, life and
death are one
As a flame burns to touch the sky, so it shall be with man's cry, and this night all will pass away, (and this night we shall die as
one)

Hear them sing the tales of glory
About a man so brave and wise
He subdued the hated tyrant
But he's unlucky, hear his cries 
Why, why, why
All of mine are dead and gone (why, why)
Oh, my absence was too long (why, why, why)
Bloody vengeance's what I swear (why, why)
Heroes grief, it makes me stong! 
In the world's most darkest hour
When he prevents the fall of man
He shakes off the yoke of evil
He is the saviour of all land 
Why, why, why
These betrayers killed my love (why, why)
But there soon will come the day (why, why, why)
For their treason they must pay (why, why)
Heroes grief, it makes me strong! 
""After Karlaak had fall he went through the forest of Troos 
where he met Zarozinia, daughter of the fallen king of the Dreaming City. 
He tried to part himself from his two glorious swords ""Stormbringer"" and ""Blade of Sorrow"",

He had to face the bitter truth of being an immortal hero

Don't ever leave the path - you have been walking on
Don't ever change - your ways, your ways - of getting alone
No chance for you - to escape - from your destination
Choose between good and bad - and make your own decision
Just be true - to yourself - and things will be coming
Don't ever try - to make them, to make them - smile at you
For in return they'll turn their back on you
A prophecy - that's what I say
And you'll find - some day
A chosen one - that's what you are
Some day you're bound to find your way
You will fight - in a world - that don't seem real
You'll have to fight in that world - you don't believe in
Don't you try to resist for things will be coming
Hit by a car - in the streets of deserted town
Wake up in dreams wondering - where you're around
A voice keeps calling
I will be lord of this land
I will be ruler of this land
No one can stop me anyway
This will all be mine some day
Run - Run - Run
Run but you can't get away -
Run but you won't change your fate -
Don't try hide away - I'll wait for you some day -

Away from your destiny
You just can't deny

And now you fight your greatest battle

Born in the end of the 1600s, his given name was Edward
One look at him would terrify, Black-Beard is what he became known as

He made himself look hellish
Framing his face in fire
By placing long lighted matches
Under his hat to strike fear in his prey

Heâd hide his ship and lay in waiting for some unsuspecting vessel
Heâd attack with such ferocity, No one ever acted so fiercely
He carried three bracers of pistols, had lots of rum for all his men
When things got slow heâd stir thing up, By shooting his guns in his dark cabin

They say he had fourteen wives
And a governorâs refuge
He came to shore quite often
He even once took the Kingâs pardon

He raped and murdered the innocent
He was the terror that sailed the sea
Along the mid-Atlantic coast
Black Beard brought horror and misery
So many met with a watery grave
So many ships fell by his hand
His pure brutality knew no bounds
The oceanâs devil and his evil band

He had taken such a toll upon the sea
All the people cried for something to be done
Then Virginias governor had had enough
He sent his own ship to capture him dead or alive

He raped and murdered the innocent

Along the mid-Atlantic coast

Metal,Zandelle,Beowulf Trilogy Iii,"In a time of warlords and kings there lived a man of unrivaled power
Might the likes of which none could match, he fought without the need of weapon in hand
Scandinavia, cold harsh land which he called home
Beowulf was his name, he was the hero of the northern realm, his legend grew strong

Further to the south there ruled a king named Hrothgar
Favored by the fortunes of war he was revered
Many followed this noble leader to enter his ranks
And in time his army grew to one mighty force

So his mind would turn to new ideas
He would build the greatest hall in all the world
It would be his throne room where heâd rule
And dispense gifts to all the good people of his land

Unbeknownst to the great king a demon from the banished lands
Began to prowl the hall, soon many would fall
Grendel would bring havoc and destruction to them all
Each night brought a new attack, the kingâs army tried to fight back
Death was their reward, through deadly wounds blood poured
Grendel was impervious to hammer spear and sword

All seemed hopeless as none could stop this beast
News traveled all across the land
Far away our hero heard the tales of what went on
The time for vital action was at hand to slay the beast

With fourteen men he then set sail south across the open sea
To Denmark, to Heorot, to the joy of the mighty Danish king

His arrival brought joy and happiness
Finally hope had arrived
Beowulf vowed to bring an end to the beast
And avenge those who had died

Grendel showed up later that night, his mind still set on ruin and carnage
But much to the demons surprise
The hero of the north was ready to fight
Savagely they fought
Filling the hall with disaster
But when morning came
Beowulf was cheered as people celebrated his victory

I'm out of control
Demon drives my actions
I'm ready for the beast
Perversion invades my mind
Impulse takes form
Start now my.... My second life

Much time is gone and I'm conscious
Of my action awake my body with the
Past no one'll give me secret
It's only for me you are the object
Of my sin, in this house i'm your God!!

Your voice is a noise
I'm inflamed from that
Attend your death in silence
Or die in an eternal pain

Metal,Zero Hour,Metamorphosis I Descent,"Deep underground it lies hidden and waits

A demon seed man or beast a tragic fate

A dark secret of one thousand years

An experiment with life

It revealed a deeper fear mans eternal strife

Something went wrong so they hid the truth from it's eyes

They starved it of knowledge bound it's hands and fed it on lies

Deep in it's mind thoughts are suspended in hate

A frozen tomb earth's womb a dire state

Who am I what am I where am I

I cannot see I cannon feel I can't believe this is not real

A dark secret hidden far underground buried and left to die

But time revealed a deeper fear it was still alive

Metal,Acid Witch,The Black Witch,"Salem 1692
Where 20 witches hanged
Sleepy village gripped by Satan
The devil's holding sway

Tituba, the black witch
Slave of the night
Possessing the minds of the puritan white
Casting her spells of African
Learned in the rites
Voodoo of the ancient macumba
The reverend's daughters howled and spit

They clearly are bewitched
Witch hunt blood lust for the general
Nubian priestess kept inquisit in bondage
The cross of the reverend torments her
For freedom and vengeance her plot has been laid to madness!

White flesh for the devil
Black demons dance in the minds of the children
Townspeople panic and charge their own kin

Crones dragged
Cut to be hung on the gallows
Into cursed ruin Salem was swallowed!

And when your casket rots, they squirm forth â¦

Upon your putrefacted flesh the worms do feast.
Creeping through your brains, they eat your spent hopes.
Crawling through your heart, they eat your secret loves.
The worms swallow all that you were, and will ever be â¦

Metal,Zombie Apocalypse,We Still Might Be Dying,"Like rubble in your hands, similar to my well-laid plans, I'm here now, rebar sticking through my ribs. Caught in the blast. Stop time with our eyes. Free from the past, from the future, from waking life. One more time before we die. We stand across a stillness that we spawn; as chaos reigns love braids us so we carry on. Dig your claws into the moment. Sink your teeth. Feel the warmth run down your cheeks devouring the bittersweet. In the cacophony, hold on to me, and I'll hold on to you as we hurtle toward the sun and certain doom. But I feel a spark in you, and I know you sense the same. So make this pact with me and let's run. Two particles in the wave making stillness, even if just in a dream. But the real world is on the horizon. It's waiting for you and me.

search for a why

and our science

last convulsions

wrong way - end of mankind

Metal,Mekong Delta,Heartbeat,"[R. Hubert, R. Hubert]

In the shadow of our industry
we constructed all these big machines
symbolizing what we want to be
superpowers of insanity 
Accepting all of this bureaucracy
content to be another wannabe
obscured by all of this complexity
consumed as fuel for even bigger dreams 
Little voices saying please sign here
you know these children are too young my dear
and the endless sound of moving parts
replaced the rhythm of their strained hearts 
While the wheels continue turning
We still believe in sold out learning
in the center are these blinded eyes
masked by a melted fire out of ice 
Answers finally came to me
inside a plastic strawberry
Creeping through your cancered skin
Remember that your life is a sin 
Lost like a heartbeat
we will never hear
Caught by the house of coldness
we all fear
And in our blindness we can't see
the ghost of all we used to be 
In the daylight of our destiny
Swimming in reflected vanity
So you smoke another cigarette
One more thing in life that you'll regret 
While the wheels continue turning
we still believe in sold out learning
in the center are these blinded eyes
masked by a melted fire out of ice 
Lost like a heartbeat
we will never hear
Caught by the house of coldness
we all fear
and in our blindness we can't see
the ghost of all we used to be

Her sky will crack
When the sun turns black
Forcing our species to collapse
As the final curtain pulls back

And what differs is woven in between
Our kind's wrongs and our kind's rights
Is the same that exists
Between the day and between the night

Her sky will crack
When the sun turns black
Forcing our species to collapse
As the final curtain pulls back

The curtain pulls back

We shall drift into the black
Our light is trapped, there's no turning back

The ghost crawls up from the basement
The ghost it weeps for the whole world

Swallow the tears

fight all your fears

jump out of the pain

into the fire

suffer for us

One shall suffer

for our sins

one must die

so we can live

take away all sin

to set us free

the sins of dozen centuries

when you thought

you'd get away

swallow your own evil

now for me


and tell me was it worth it?


Swallow their tears

they're shed in despair

ignore all their fears

this world isn't fair

spit out your anger

spit out your fire

spit out deseases

to those who desire

rip out their devour

spit out the plagues

on this rotten empire


He came

from the fleece of the heathen

woven world of the elders

the uspoken, unseen

Creeping

right out of the remains of

the all shattered ruins of

the place that was home


Last planets breathing

but still no one knows whats right?

A bleeding heart is mine

And allthis veritable mutants

killing with a smile

white lily of the Nile

And all this spat out rulers,

lawless - vapid painted mall

A silent stone in time


Swallow all tears

we shed in despair

erase all our fears

this world isn't fair

ease our anger

light us a fire

heal our deseases

and shake off desire

lighten our hearts

and fill them with joy

we know you're a liar

you sealed our doom

So here we are to face the fear

Could dreams portray the true side, before the stars surrender to light?

I feel the earth turning beneath my feet
While the clouds seem to spin above my head

So here we are to face the fear
Divided minds could never see so clear
Could dreams portray the true side, before the stars surrender to light?

Pain still remains!

Darkness gathers, strength infecting me
Emptiness controls my every need
Distant memories are all I see
Spirals downward, drowning endlessly

I hold on tightly, I'm so afraid
And to let go would be my last mistake

Close my eyes, deep breaths
Close my eyes, deep breaths

Forever changing the story told, the inner core lost forevermore (forevermore)

Slowing down, I hit the ground to face the fear (that)
The end is near
Close my eyes, reach my demise, nothing left to fear

Drag heaving bags, in devilish rags, to the door of the spider that waits

And behind my thick glasses, I dream of their asses, butchered and ready to eat


A tape of horror sounds of fright

To lure them to my lair

Masked effigies and eerie lights

and a large bowl filled with sweets...


Trick or Treat


You've all heard this tale, in every village and vale, every  neighborhood has someone like me

Some say its folklore, to keep kids from straying too far, but I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing

For I am that man, in the white cargo van, and I'm prowling and ready to strike

I feign normalcy, so they wont think of me, when a kid goes missing Halloween night

Metal,Zao,Physician Heal Thyself,"Physician heal thyself
Can you cut yourself precise and deep
As to reach in and remove what's dying inside of you
A colossus of irony
Physician heal thyself
With great intelligence and experience
Can you prescribe a way not to die alone
We are not what we are
The structure deconstructing
Arrogance and blasphemy
There are no controls
Like the unfortunate patient
The physician dies sick and
Alone

Metal,Zakk Wylde,The Color Green,"[Bonus Track]

I recall when you once said,
""There's a truth in both of us
And all that lies ahead.""
I take it your tongue
It just got twisted
Or maybe it got tired
Or maybe your memory waved goodbye

When your so called friends forget your name
When your so called friends, they ain't the same
When your so called friends, they've lost their way
And they ain't what they was just the other day, hey
Should've listened to what my folks, they had to say
Just like a dog that's turned on you
Ain't it funny what the colour green will make some people do?

How I couldn't see through your thin disguise
Lord only knows and such a fool was I
Happy go lucky, that's what I was and what I hope to be
But I feel that I've lost that side of me

When your so called friends forget your name
When your so called friends, they ain't the same
When your so called friends, they've lost their way
And they ain't what they was just the other day, hey
Should've listened to what my folks, they had to say
Just like a dog that's turned on you
Ain't it funny what the colour green will make some people do?

Metal,Acidtree,Caged Sun,"The oath must not be broken
The luminous city will stand forever
Built by sacred demand
Granting the wish of the One
River, mountain and sand
Under the watching sun

These are just words
Remnants of shattered dreams
Buried in the dust

One King, one God
He casts His light upon the land
To guide the frail hearts of men
When the disc rests in the distant west
Darkness is a shroud
Everything is still

I can see you
Blessed with the power to lead mankind
They will understand the divine

One folk, one realm
The gift of life in all its forms
Humans, beasts and plants are born

Daybreak fills the earth with life and grace
And we are reborn
Reveling in his warmth

I can see you
Blessed with the power to lead mankind
They will understand the divine

O precious light
Shine bright
The purest gold is sand
Next to your splendor

I was betrayed
The city can't stop its decay
Is it too late?
Will the divine land be destroyed
By the hate of men
Victims of envy and revenge
Witchcraft, credulity
Ignorance and misery

Fear my wrath and despair
I'll erase all your names

Sailing down the Nile
I see a land so pure and serene
Virtuous lore revealed to me
There will be no hunger, war, disease.

Shadows fall to earth
The path to light is lost
Men were left alone in dreamless sleep
Truth stays concealed within our souls

ON a cruel grey morning Alone they stand with heads

in hands They lost one they lost one along the way And they're still and they're still mourning today

Shed the tears forgive the years though it hurts to

Feel that way today No one knows why we die so live

through For there is no other way Some may

believe in things they've never seen Though we must

wake we can live the dream The reasons for the day

no one knows still we take the thorns with the rose memories they fade and now I know No matter how full the

river must grow Some may believe in things

they've never seen Though we must wake we can live

the dream Throw away the ties that bind you And all that you have heard And when you find your way

And know the meaning You can forget their words A field of white reflects the light Of a rose upon

a tomb And they're still and they're still

Never ever figured Lord love would leave me feeling

Metal,Dance Club Massacre,Shenanigans,"Let's get drunk.

The troops are assembled and ordered to loosen their ties.

For on this sabbath day, the fortress is ours.

Every hour the shot heard around the world is shot by the likes of Jack or Jose.

What is this place you ask?   

It's where we resurrect ourselves from one week ago.

Free roam.

Everything is ours.

What is this place you ask?

It's Shannon's pub.

Who wants to be immortal?

Who wants to drink from the Fountain of Youth?

Who wants free food and arcade golf?

With this treasure you'll never ever grow old.

The rules are simple, gentlemen.

Once you walk through those doors there's no way out.

And there's no last call in this port.

Everyone is the captain and they abide the code.

So when this ship has sunk, well then so will I, with honor and my fill.

With no rules it's like Camp Nowhere without the Lloyd of course.

But then again, maybe we should get the doc.

This way we can go back in time and relive the memories of when we rocked the house.

Where everybody knows your name.

And they're always glad you came.

You wanna be where you can see.

Our troubles are all the same.

You wanna be where everybody knows your name.

How Does The Blind Make Differance
Talking Monkeys Scorning All Truth In Fear
I Could Join Them But I Will Never Be Near

Borned And Taught By My Kind
I Learned Their Aims And Goals
Now To Be Scorned And Looked Down On
For Their Lies I Disobeyed
Disrupting Their Garded Patterns
They Fear I Will Break Their Circles
And Disseminate Clearness
The Weak Fear My Mind

So Then Hear My Oath Thou Of My Kind

Behold My Affront To Thy Hierarchies

symbolizing what we want to be
superpowers of insanity 
Accepting all of this bureaucracy
content to be another wannabe
obscured by all of this complexity
consumed as fuel for even bigger dreams 
Little voices saying please sign here
you know these children are too young my dear
and the endless sound of moving parts
replaced the rhythm of their strained hearts 
While the wheels continue turning
We still believe in sold out learning
in the center are these blinded eyes
masked by a melted fire out of ice 
Answers finally came to me
inside a plastic strawberry
Creeping through your cancered skin
Remember that your life is a sin 
Lost like a heartbeat
we will never hear
Caught by the house of coldness
we all fear
And in our blindness we can't see
the ghost of all we used to be 
In the daylight of our destiny
Swimming in reflected vanity
So you smoke another cigarette
One more thing in life that you'll regret 
While the wheels continue turning
we still believe in sold out learning
in the center are these blinded eyes
masked by a melted fire out of ice 
Lost like a heartbeat
we will never hear
Caught by the house of coldness
we all fear
and in our blindness we can't see

But after all the things that I did and after all the sins that I committed, one day I heard about Jesus.
I'm just like the woman that heard about Jesus coming through the city of Jericho, and she had a problem.
But I had a problem with lying too and lying was sin.

I was living in sin, living and doing things I wanted to do, living and seeing what I wanted to see.
But one day Jesus touched my life and when Jesus came in the liquor went out, the drugs went out... my old lady... the lord ble...
I thank God my sins and judge every, and I have a right to the tree...

Doesn't mean jack to me and everyone that knows Jesus and everyone that's been born again and everyone that's been washed in the blood you heard the brother singin' about the blood, it's stuff about the blood, it's stuff about the blood of Jesus and wash away your sins and wash your mind and wash your heart and wash your life, oh praise God.

I thank God for that opportunity, and I just wanna let you know that he loves us and the Bible backs it up:
""That God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whoever should believe in him shall not perish but have an everlasting life...""

What's the plan when he comes through this door what happens?
Speak up, Butch, please.
Well he goes on and goes up to the elevator, gets drunk.

Are you gonna be saying something to him or be talking to him?

Metal,Melechesh,Mystics Of The Pillar,"Lions' will
Lions' will as living form
Mystics of the golden column
Revealed the pictures of the unknown
Snakes and ladders will keep you above

Stylites over stone pillars
Pilgrims of the mind's eye
Irrational reflections recur as multi reason
Wait for hidden answers, they are cosmic beams

Neither Enki, nor Ishtar
Can see through the sacred blackened mirror

Abide by the bygone code
Snub the shrouding archetypes
The prime project alter reason
Evolution of the soul
Their thoughts are veiled

May the sands of Mashu bless them
While the cloud bridge the mountains
Devourers of sacred notions
Bring us answers, bring down the sky

Neither Enki, nor Ishtar
Can see through the sacred blackened mirror

May the sands of Mashu bless them

Cite the owners of the throne
Embrace madness for it is sanity
Mystics of the shining pillars
Isolate the soul from extinguished body

Cite the owners of the throne
Embrace madness for it is sanity
Mystics of the shining pillars
Isolate the soul from hybrid flesh

I call you thrice and come
A chamber filled yet hollow
Arraign the tenets of lies
That shrouds the third eye of the mind

May the sands of Mashu bless them

DEATH DID NOT GAIN THEM FREEDOM SO HERE THEY STAYED

Metal,Zavorash,The Superior Creed,"[Music: Nil, Backing Vocals: Hordemaster Christ, Gashpau, Lyrics: Totalscorn]

Long I searched what they claim to see, and the beauty derived thereof
Asking why I felt like a menace, to them - who everything solved
My differences seemed racial, though ancestors I then lacked
Until the orchard of mind opened, and I stood completely aback

Empty and enlightened, I drank of the miracles
Torn in the metaphysical, the void became a creed
As I lost all the addictions, and triumphed in deterministic rule
Propounding world perversion, in the eyes of the herd

No purity, except a tidal hatred
No sorrow, though an ego degraded
And love... I miss this false heaven

Let it embrace, no meaning of life
Never repent, no meaning in lies
Faith signed with crossbones
Ecstasy... all meaning dies!

Insanity, if I by thee could be characterised
But my laugh is not that of a madman
It is the fall of one too wise
Darkness, if thee were to be my palfrey
But with fiction even evil died
Hence I quashed my last hospice

This is the creed transcending all minds, the end of malformed tales
Reaching for every thought misbegotten, feel the void of reality's nails

I'm the son of hidden root of life
Sons of the earth, listen to your teachers
Sons of the fire who came from the deepest
Darkness...
Son of fire
I'm their leading spirit and guide
When I begin my deed I'll build all
For effigy of the ancient circles
Of non-passing days
Fiery rotating gale
Will fulfil its mission in rotary move
Like a lightning pierce the fiery clouds
Son of fire
Here's dark space, descendant of the fire of truth
Since now let it be eternal darkness
Only fire, messenger of the ancient fathers last
Only fire...

With visions of yesteryear and rivers of  blood they shed

For a reign of terror the outcasts
Will be used against themselves through ignorance and lies
And so in hate my numbers grow and soon all the world will know
A twisted universal mind a mind like mine
Back to a time when I was young a father tells an only son
You are the chosen one
And as I grew so did my hate to cleanse the land became my fate
I became the gun
If the child grows knowing only what it's told
Then the man can learn only as his history unfolds
The roots of hatred we don't always see and so are left to grow
Fear begins in ones center and when allowed to flow
Will cast ripples upon still waters destroying all it knows
The disenfranchised will brutalize those who are not the same
The immigrants and infidels will be the pawn in their game
And they will use you against yourself through ignorance and lies
Hear that voice once again tie the borders
We need some order take a stand
So the politicians reach the white man
With loaded words a foot on the bible and rifle in their hands
Return to a time when you were young
When love lit your way
And all your troubles amounted to none
But who could who could say
But still do we really ever understand how we can love the child
But crucify the man
And do we ever really see that
""I could have been him and he could have been me""
Remember a time when you were young
When love cradled the day
And you did not know the difference between right and wrong
So who led who led the way
Now will you be the voice of reason when there's none
Who will who will sing it's song
I will

And it make it's wall deplete

They made it out like the child on the mind more look and find you'll see it

And it look O.K. to me

And moat a bite a lee

And makes it five to fourteen

Well, I knocked down on your door, baby,
to see if you were at home.
Your shade was down, there wasn't even a sound
but something told me you weren't alone.
What in the world can a nasty dog do
but try to get next to you?

Don't laugh 'cause it ain't funny.
Look how it happened to me.
It could happen to you, you could be a fool too
and it'd leave you in misery.
I guess there's nothin' more a funky king can do
but to try to get next to you.

When you'll come back home again
Weary from the fight
I will nurse your wounds and I'll
release you from your weights 
You must be hungry and
There's blood upon your hands
So please come in and I will cure your fever 
Why don't you rest your head
You long for warmth I bet
You needn't worry of a thing when I'm near 
(He's the cure)
I'm the cure
I'm the cure 
What can just light up your heart
When you're in the dark
What just makes privation worth
What's dearer to a man 
To see this face again
To touch this body and
To feel the blood pulsating in your veins 
Your hunger will be fed
For every tear you've shed
You'll get the threefold pay in just one long night 
(He's the cure)
I'm the cure
I'm the cure

Be frozen tonight


Lost in the darkness, inevitable fate

Being haunted by a million screams 



Feel he's creeping and crawling

No one turns on a light, be paralyzed

Faces hit onto the ground

When the fog comes over

As night becomes the day

Has swept it all away

And the haunting is over

Metal,Dance Club Massacre,"Who Are You, And What Have You Done With Six","In the wonder years I was in my own domain.

Thrashing to Phil, and Mustaine.

Then I picked up a CD with a pair of breasts wrapped in barbed wire.

This day will go down in infamy.

There was no dress code.

No clique to separate the men, women, and children.

My own kind of club.

Good times and great memories like the classic cabana.

The wine was fine and the trumpets ranged.

And upon rekindling this deathly siege things weren't exactly the same.

Now I travel apart of the team.

The teams been sold to the Devil himself.

You'd think he would know what to do, the anthems devoted to his dynasty are portrayed yet sabotaged.

Who's got the time for team spirit nowadays?

I don't feel quite at home.

I'm brand new.

This isn't where I thought I was going.

This place is not the same as I left it.

The old me would kick the new me's ass if he wasn't shorter.

What's with the new style?

Where were the chicks when I was dope?

But I guess it's OK.

Like Ben said, 200 solemn faces are you.

And underground I feel cool in my youth, which by the way has passed, but I'm still cool.

Check me out, I'm rocking the house.

I'd hope Dimmu would be proud.

And underground I feel cool in my youth, which by the way has passed, but I'm still cool.

Cursed is living among fleeting generations
Damned is lasting in the calm of anonymous grave
Formula of immortality placed by my side
Where are the mouths, which will vivify its substance
I'm waiting for the time
When my brothers find me
Bestial wings cut cold air
Courier of darkness flits to set fire
To hearts frozen by time
Extinguished before ages
Time of rebellion is coming

I'll destroy the temples of false mysticism

But the road ahead was full of danger
He never dreamed of the risks he'd find
As he traveled this road of earth and sand

Now he fights on
Struggles to survive day by day
Eternal champion
To the gods of chaos doeth he pray

Warrior from a race of evil
Savior is what he wants to be
Wanderer he travels on forever
Tries to find that which he doeth seek

He gets so close but still too far
Always fall short of his goal
Determination drives him on and on
From a magic blade he gets his power
As it drink the souls of his enemies
Longs to return to a home that's so far gone

Always travelling
Hoping that one day he'll see his home
Self-banished emperor
For how much longer must he roam?

His cousin rules his land
As he faces death everywhere he turns
He tries to find the answers
That he has yet to find
The flame of conviction in his soul burns

But I had a problem with lying too and lying was sin.

I was living in sin, living and doing things I wanted to do, living and seeing what I wanted to see.

You might be right
Hold your fire
I'll take you higher
Never drop
We'll never stop

Tar for feathers
Blood for honey
Milk for money
Isn't it funny how it hurts
How it hurts

You never see me make
The same mistake twice
You never see a tear
Coming out of these eyes
You never see me beg
For another shot
And you never see me change
Into something I'm not
Famous last words

Stare at someone
You used to know
Laughs at you
Turns around and fade away
If only I could see it that way

Kill your senses
It can't be right
Isn't it funny how it hurts

You never see me make
The same mistake twice
You never see a tear
Coming out of these eyes
You never see me quit
See me disengage
And you never see me spit in your face
Out of rage
Famous last words

I don't know for how long I've been around this place
One reason to live on
Don't know why this dark days should be mine
And those old ones - bodies of machines
Cold price for endless life
Still see those Gates I once stepped through

Nothing certain or true...

Frozen sea
Just reflect me

Tumbling through this unreal lifeless scene
Absorbed in hopeless thoughts
Don't know what happened to this world

All is certain not true...

What I see
Is creating me

Must be strong within my thoughts
Have to find someone who knows
Somewhere truth must have survived
I must walk on to find a sing

I don't know why
I don't know why
I
What's true
True

Your heart is desperate for little piece of feelings

Your brain is begging

like a waste of time.

Hopelessness and frustration

to end this life...

What does it mean - friends?

They are tearing you apart.

Poison doesn't taste

as bad as you've expected

Every time

And see my mother's eyes
But when hers close
I'm scared so will mine
You are no brothers
Filing out the church of

Hiding its sins deep in its stomach
Digesting them one at a time
And your voice is a sounding trumpet
Announcing the mountains that you've moved
But love is the farthest thing from you

you scream that silent scream
Searching in your misery to find
some wasted common theme
Torn and battered, laid to rest
no one there, just pain
Can't ya see my withered face?
The lines they seem so plain

Choose your way, Quench your thirst
Black or white
The chosen ones will fight the fight!

Looking back through the haze I see a lonely boy
A rage inflamed by a foolish fear of becoming what he hates
Empty, drained, abandoned days will never be repaid
They frame a mind to do the same or maybe break the chain

He is lost, He is broken he is cracked and crushed He is chosen
Are we lost? Are we broken? Are we cracked and crushed? Are we chosen?
I was lost, I was broken I was cracked and crushed I was chosen
Are you lost? Are you broken? Are you cracked and crushed? Are you chosen?

""Show me delights beyond belief! I call
Give me the pleasures Azag-Thoth
Of the stars the moon and the endless night""

From a distance, I saw the wells of Koth
I felt the frozen winds of Yugoth
I heard the faceless god
Screaming blind over abysmal cliffs

I travelled through the mountain of Seth
As the dark spirits covered the sun
I caress the power and wisdom
(That he unleashed) like a soothing wind

Some talk of the horrors lurking deep in the universe...

I sat beside the river of silver tears
And I gazed at the sky and heard a quiet melody
Then I beheld the Nereids of the woods
And she called me inside the passage
The passage to the unconceived Abyss
Screams from amorphous masses of emptiness
The fiends of dark they drag me
Into the mighty dimensions of the Ancient Ones

swallow your own faeces

and tell me was it worth it?


Swallow the tears

you shed in despair

fight all your fears

this world isn't fair

jump out of the pain

into the fire

suffer for us

One shall suffer

for our sins

one must die

so we can live

take away all sin

to set us free

the sins of dozen centuries

when you thought

you'd get away

swallow your own evil

now for me


and tell me was it worth it?


Swallow their tears

they're shed in despair

ignore all their fears

this world isn't fair

spit out your anger

spit out your fire

spit out deseases

to those who desire

rip out their devour

spit out the plagues

on this rotten empire


He came

from the fleece of the heathen

woven world of the elders

the uspoken, unseen

Creeping

right out of the remains of

the all shattered ruins of

the place that was home


Last planets breathing

but still no one knows whats right?

A bleeding heart is mine

And allthis veritable mutants

killing with a smile

white lily of the Nile

And all this spat out rulers,

lawless - vapid painted mall

A silent stone in time


Swallow all tears

we shed in despair

erase all our fears

this world isn't fair

ease our anger

light us a fire

heal our deseases

and shake off desire

lighten our hearts

and fill them with joy

we know you're a liar

you sealed our doom

The path of final war embarked upon, brother versus brother, love is forlorn,
Life laid waste, all crawling for the swords, commeth storms, times of no remorse,
I am the bearer of true darkness, behold what this sign enshrines,
Prophet of pure genocide, embattled, this age is mine.

Ye have spoken in my ears in fearsome words, oh, ye have threatened and cried in vain,
Thy fate my servant, death my fame, the one voice known to graves,
All calls forlorn and rotten, shredd by my immortal grinn,
Enemies, debris, all to be laid down, foundation's prison shaking, crumbling.

Rules so adored will not keep me still, emperor, within thy madness,
Behold the Everything, dust as I have passed, embrace me, thy brother, as hatred reach for thy heart,
As the world weeps I grow stronger, all this death is my gain,
Every life that goes under, goes under my name.

Falsehood of hope proven, the dark one, the fiction fears thee need,
Hope has failed, these is only me, so eat my wisdom apple, then drink my poison wine,
Get drunk from scornful laughter, still, death comes to all in time,
Saw beyond the void of everything, my reflection greets me there.

Only there none fear me, none, only those I fear,
The thorns in my heart familiar, I drove them in there,
Behold me, for I am thy prophet, fate of life, man's nature,
My gardens dark and dead, I shall the truth spread...

Leaving you in the abyss of demise, fight thy haunting guilts tonight

Metal,Zero Hour,Face The Fear,"Pain still remains, redirect this change, release all the rage, that's in me

Mind screams to me, useless memories, brings me to my knees, no release

Death was only a vision, away, the only direction I knew
A path forever winding down, sanity find me somehow

So here we are to face the fear
Divided minds could never see so clear
Could dreams portray the true side, before the stars surrender to light?

I feel the earth turning beneath my feet
While the clouds seem to spin above my head

So here we are to face the fear
Divided minds could never see so clear
Could dreams portray the true side, before the stars surrender to light?

Pain still remains!

Darkness gathers, strength infecting me
Emptiness controls my every need
Distant memories are all I see
Spirals downward, drowning endlessly

I hold on tightly, I'm so afraid
And to let go would be my last mistake

Close my eyes, deep breaths
Close my eyes, deep breaths

Forever changing the story told, the inner core lost forevermore (forevermore)

Slowing down, I hit the ground to face the fear (that)
The end is near
Close my eyes, reach my demise, nothing left to fear
The end is here
The end is here

Time, time is lost - not mine, the inner changing ride I live
To tell my story lost in time, I'd live again - I'd live again!

Live again!

Metal,Zeraphine,No Tears,"At a second glance 
You thought you recognised despair
For a fraction of a second 
You were searching for a reason
You pretended cheerfully, 
But instead you tried to hide away
When everybody's laughter 
Seems to rip you all apart

And your life carries on the same
And your life will be the same

Going back again to see 
Stages from the recent past
But everywhere you turn
There is no chance to continue
Nothing really holds you back 
&gt;From stepping through that yesterday
For every new beginning
There will be some other end

And when you cry there are no tears left for liberation
You don't listen to your own explanations
There are no rules you left behind from your desperation
There's no need to fear the way, that you've led

You'll run again, 
Faster than you've ever been
You don't feel the cold, 
It's never been like this before
Determination in your eyes, 
Now you don't know the reasons why
You can't say goodbye
But you never really said hello

It's the same train that took us to the twinspirit land
this means that you are about to wake up from your dream
this train is going to bring us back to where we once met!

[Genius] Oh my God! Now I see it!
[Genius &amp; Twinspirit n.32] It's coming right this way!
[Genius] Tell me please! What should we do?
How can we get the prince back to European reign?

[Twinspirit n.32] This train will be carrying us back to the Kingdom gates
and it will be passing through the European Kingdom
at that point you and the prince will jump off the train
and you'll run fast to the jails where Mc Chaos is being kept!

[Genius] No! No! No! I won't go alone!
You'll come with me!
[Twinspirit n.32] No! I won't! I must try to stay alive until you're arrived
here I will be safe!

[Twinspirit n.32 &amp; main choir] Jump off this train!
[Genius] I need your help! I can't go alone!
[Twinspirit n.32 &amp; main choir] Jump off this train!
[Twinspirit n.32] I'm sure you will be brave!
[Twinspirit n.32 &amp; main choir] Jump off this train!
[Genius] I just can't let you go to sure death!
[Twinspirit n.32 &amp; main choir] Jump off this train!
[Twinspirit n.32] No more words! Just...
[Twinspirit n.32 &amp; main choir] Jump! Off! This! Train!

[Twinspirit n.32] All right...
Every twinspirit has a multimedia storage support built inside,
where all the memories of the dream they are leading are stored.
They cannot give it out for any reason.
Before they die, at the end of the dream, they transfer it's content to the dreaming human mind
and in order to preserve his privacy, they destroy this storage.
Sometimes the human remembers the dream, sometimes he does not,
but the dream's memories are always transferred to his mind by it's assigned twinspirit.
In this case, I think that my memory storage content is the only thing that could
demonstrate that you were admitted here by the Doorkeepers and prove King Mc Chaos' innocence, once and for all.
Even if what I'm going to do is strongly illegal, here's a disk with a copy of these memories stored inside of me!
We are getting close to the European Kingdom!
You'll have to jump off this train and run fast to the Kingdom jails
and show the contents of this disk to the Senators!
I'll try to survive and give you enough time to get this done.
I hope to resist, and I hope you'll have enough time before you awake!
So... Prepare to jump when I'll tell you to go!

[Genius] What're you saying?
What does this mean?
Won't you come with me?
I won't let you in this sad train!
I won't let you die!
[Twinspirit n.32] It's all right! Don't you cry!
This is how it goes in this world!
I'm ready to face my fate!

[Twinspirit n.32 &amp; main choir] Jump off this train!
[Genius] I need your help! I can't go alone!
[Twinspirit n.32 &amp; main choir] Jump off this train!
[Twinspirit n.32] I'm sure you will be brave!
[Twinspirit n.32 &amp; main choir] Jump off this train!
[Genius] I just can't let you go to sure death!
[Twinspirit n.32 &amp; main choir] Jump off this train!
[Twinspirit n.32] Move your ass and jump! Off!
I said jump! Off! This! Damned! Train!

[Twinspirit n.32] Stop your whining, human!
I'm looking forward to leaving you forever.
I want to make clear in your dumb head our roles to this comedy.
You are the one enslaving me through my short life
by giving me life and making me die at your command!
I'm not your friend... I hate you!
But I'm going to die... Finally! So I'll be free of your blithering!
Now, the least you can do is try to clean all the mess
you caused due to your presence here!
So... Jump! Off! This! Damned! Train!

[Storyteller] They arrived at the point. Twinspirit 32 extracted the memory support and looked firmly into Genius' eyes. Genius was petrified by his reaction. He really could not believe his own ears. Tears started to flow down his cheeks. Genius jumped out of the train's door and fell on the grass. The prince was not hurt and the memory support was still safe in his pocket. He stood up and stared at the train for some seconds. Deep in his heart he was hoping that his twinspirit had spoken rudely just in order to convince him to jump. Suddenly he turned his back and started to run towards the European jails. The train transporting the twinspirits to their end was continuing it's ride. Twinspirit 32 did not expect that the conductor of that train was a special person that was waiting for the right moment to act fatally.

Slowly coils around your closed mind

Skull removed, exposing the brain to the world

Choke on the disinformation that they feed
In a glorified planet-wide lab
Hold still society, it's just a quick jab
Strapped down with the cranium exposed

Plastic gloves and a surgeon's mask
Blood dripping down your forehead
Reminiscing of a third eye
Now you're fucking open-minded, bitch

Obscured by the residual leftovers of a greedy infestation
A swarm, swarming the world like a disease
Infecting every putrid sect with isolation
Manipulation on a planet-wide scale

Metal,Zavorash,Human Delirium,"During Times To Elderly To Be Thought Of, Thirsting I Was So I Drank The Eons Wine
Instantly Was I Forlorn In Divine Wisdom, My Grave Was Now Made Centuries Ago
Forgotten Was I Now Long Before My Birth, Without Regret I Opened The Gates To Earth
Amongst The Stones And Dust Of Battles Lost, I Hunted And Laughed For God I Now Was

Though Lost Was I Once Before Reality Was Brought Asunder
Dead Was I Once During Times When Lost Were The Poisen Wine
But In Strength I Arose And Devoured The Universe
And Became My Own Precious Lord And Slave

So Rightly I Call Myself The Powered Very Essence
""By Which Their Pestilent Prayers Are Formed
Life Did Once Teach Me The Most Horrid Of Lessons
Though Still, They Fail To Grasp, I Am Not Horned

But As All Gods Should I Be Adorned!""

I Represent The Denied And Dead Universal Error
In Close Parallels I Mock The Worshipped Truth
My Shining Aura Is That Of A Great Emperor
And In My Chronicles There Is No Sign Of Truce
My Names Are Many, Forever I Am Known
An Angel, Savior, Whore Or Ruler
As I Dance Through The Crippled Walls Of Moral
And Damn Only Those Who Speak The Truth

I Am Rationalisms' Very Foundation, Still Insanity Is My God-given Name
Truth Is For Me Monumental, Still Through Illusions I Reign
The Paradox Of My Hybris Is Striking, As I Demand To Be King Of Existence
As I Rape And Torture In Blackest Hate, ""Mankind, How I Love Thy Contradictive Faith""

Yet, But A Humble Slave To The Present Word I Am
Yet, I Kneel On The Cold Deaf Stone
Though We All Have Errors, Only Others We Scorn
For I Am I Creature Of Honor
And I Have My Precious Soul
The Future Shalt Reap My Crimes
""Made Real By A Horde Of Ruling Sheep

I Shalt No Death Of Theirs Weep...""

No one has ever tried to use the teleport in the opposite direction and get to the stores. But, it worked and, casually, they were sent to the European ""Japanes Fantasies"" store]

The two teleported themselves away from the European twin spirit land; they made it just in time to avoid being caught by the Dream League Force. There were many weird japanese objects that randomly disappeared, even though a twin spirit requested and teleported them away in order to create dreams. While the two were walking around, nearly lost in the endless area, their ears started to pick up a nice guitar melody comeing from somewhere. That music was not unknown to Genius...

Metal,Zao,Exchange,"Revelation, unknowing has been taken. Why had I waited so long? Refrained 
for this love. Never open to the hope He has. How could reject this? He was 
calling my name. Searchin for me. I always turnd away. Not anting to believe 
I have a need for Him. Feling this emptiness. Not knowing he could fill. 
Drowning in my efforts to find comfort. I searched and strived for the 
answer. But every step I fell and the earth crumbled underneath me. Now I 
found this rock.This stable place. The pain has gone away. I place my hope 
in no other. My heart, it cries, it toils inside me. Wantin all to have this 
life. Wanting all to know this love, but I'm reminded of my turning. Closing 
my eyes. Running the other way, but I've decided. I open my eyes to find 
more than I was looking for. My mind screams. Knowing this is for all, but 
not all I want I've found. Now I found this rock. This stable place. The

Metal,Damnation Angels,Reborn,"Â 
The world is slowly caving in
as my darkness grows within
These walls are sanctuary for me
I know that others would rather die

They will not let me be alone
and for them I gave my soul
And somehow I feel I am reborn
I've been reborn

I've paid the price for my own mistakes
But am I born into a fate I can't change
This pain of life that never seems to end
And I wonder why

There's something not quite right in me
I ask why the world was so cruel to me
And just like the darkness surrounds my soul
I wake to the feeling I've been here before

You ask me why I have faith in God
And became my own worst fear
You live in a world where no one seems to care
Let me take you there

There's something not quite right in me
I ask why the world was so cruel to me
And just like the darkness surrounds my soul
I wake to the feeling I've been here before
Am I living this life once more
This pain of life that never seems to end

I can't change what's become of me
I can only wish for what might have been
I pray for the day I finally die
Until then I will wonder why

There's something not quite right in me
I ask why the world was so cruel to me
And just like the darkness surrounds my soul
I wake to the feeling I've been here before

There's something not quite right in me
I ask why the world was so cruel to me
And just like the darkness surrounds my soul
I wake to the feeling I've been reborn

I have been reborn

Splendid trees and good for food

Satanic seduction
Satanic seduction

In the middle of the garden
He planted the tree
Of the knowledge of good and evil
And He commanded the man

'Don't eat from that tree 
Or you will surely die'

But the serpent persuaded the woman 
To eat from the forbidden tree

'When you eat of it your eyes will be opened 
And you will be like GOD
Knowing good and evil
And you will not surely die'

As the woman looked at the fruit 
She thought it would be good for food

So she took some and ate it 
And also her husband 
Then their eyes where opened
And they realised that they were naked

And sin was born

'Who told you that you are naked?' 
The LORD asked
'Have you eaten from the tree
From which I told you not to eat?'

'Cursed is the ground because of you 
Through painful toil you will eat of it
All the days of your life
It will produce thorns and thistles for you
By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food

Until you return to the ground
Since from it you were taken
For dust you are
And to dust you will return'

Birds are mute, the land stands still
Children play with candlelight
Elders fear the cursed sight

Through the night, all winter long
One can hear an ancient song
Carried by the northern breeze
Blood and bones and heart would freeze:

""Follow, follow, follow me
Follow to the hanging tree
Raise the black flag, ring the bell
Time has come to say farewell""

""Bring the fire, bring the rope
There's no future, there's no hope
Hang 'em fast and hang 'em high
Time has come for you to die""

Sifting through the hard dried mud
There it feeds on flesh and blood
Bodies swinging to and fro
Death is near, so sings the crow:

""Follow, follow, follow me
Follow to the hanging tree
Raise the black flag, ring the bell
Time has come to say farewell""

""Bring the fire, bring the rope
There's no future, there's no hope
Hang 'em fast and hang 'em high

Insanity begins to take it's toll
I try to run but the demons are from within
I see your face and I
Can't stand the way I feel
Your gentle features all covered with
The crimson rain

Now in my darkest hour
Demons from below torture my soul
I still see the blood on my hands
The guilt is killing me
I can't take any more

I look back on that night and the tears
They roll down my face
The love we had I know
That I cannot replace
I did not think it was you
Walking through the dark
I went into shock when I saw
The bullet had pierced your heart

Metal,Zerakiel,Screaming Butterfly,"Hit to the ground like a dying bird
Blasphemed due the fragility
Blood on the hands as a memory from the past
From innocence, from euphoria
Shame and broken skulls
As a gift from yesterday
What the hell happened?
My paradise is burning

Nobody can take away
My great darkness
I fall into the abyss of slumber
The Suffering world around me
My heart can not hear
My soul like a screaming butterfly

I will rise from the fire
I was reincarnated
I am my own god
I'm not wearing the Crown of Thorns
Rose peaks stings
Inflamed wounds leaks
Why do you cry?
Your paradise is burning

""Something is coming... I wait
I embrace the midnight light
You're waiting for the instructions
But the prophets are gone
And you are lost""

In turn of the chaos kingdom and terror
A fighter's soul
He travels my road of obscurity
Declaring the great celebration of the blood

I have nightmares at night
With the souls that I sacrificed
So that my sanctified armor
If it perpetuated with the spilled blood

The call becomes pleased
When the cruel spirits
That stop until my feet
And they ask your master for mercy

In the halls of your hell
Nocturnal voices whispering my name

Depraved angels... temples in tears
They give me force to send my hate scream
To all that against my blasphemy
It is opposed until the death

Purity raped from whatâs divine 
Sickness like possession deep in the crossings of your soul 
There is no savior

Careless words are daggers thrown unaware
Unapproachable unwilling silence from a sounding voice

The tongue creates it

Metal,Acrania,Servants Of Hypocrisy,"Welcome to the illusion you're suspended in, wasting time with the worshiping of such charismatic puppets, just like sheep led to the shepherd. Why don't you take a look inside your precious hierarchy? Wasting time with worshiping a contradictious web of bludgeoned truths spun by the twisted and sick tongue of ever so desperate men, cattle! You're blinded, herded by a falsely approved prophet. You're blinded, drowning in a disgusting lack of individuality, servants of hypocrisy, brainwashed by religious belief. How the fuck did we let our race become like cattle? You're blinded, drowning in a sea of disillusion. You're blinded! They've got you distracted. Mind well and truly twisted and warped with inconsistencies. Specimens of mass distraction. How did we let our race become like cattle?

Laughing at the crowds outside religious institutions while they're plotting vile intrusions of your mind. In time, their secrets will be unveiled. Knowledge fractured and jaded.
What was always encapsulated in the essence of life itself, but you'll obey while your priests say ""amen,"" as they molest. Your priests say ""amen,"" while they molest.

Awake yet sleeping, grazing on their fields of inhibitions. Stop sleeping! End all of this misguided bliss. Time to play with consciousness and explore your potential as a being of the universe, undistracted by their fairy tales. Stop slaving! Leaders sit on thrones of gold, while watching children starve. Churches are rich, while millions suffer. ""Please just give us three pounds a month."" What? Are you dumb? Do the math! They're scamming humanity! Wake up, you servile cunts! Cunts!

There is nothing to be taught. Just look inside. The truth will set you free. Just abandon this pack mentality. A pawn of beliefs, useful manipulation techniques, you see? So many wars constructed under your force fed systems of control.

Now the financially warped whisper orders to the puppets of their misguiding regimes. ""Make your followers say, amen while we molest. Make them say ""Amen,"" make them say ""Amen,"" while they molest them! ...And rape their minds, making them submissive to the will of those who wish to dominate over them. Amen. Amen.

They are the most precious in my opinion

But the rest is lovely too

Like the brain,the main part

It gives you heart


On and on and on and on

Repetitive is part of my love


And I know your worst,orphans too

Hold your breath,hold your words till

The end is what they call for,pretender

Embrace the life and my dawn,born and gone

Taken us for all we're wort

Stalking out their prey

Represent themselves from hell

For how long we do not know
We do what we can, we can do no more
Cause sooner or later we'll go
When will it end, how much time is left
Will I know when my time is near?
Will there be a tunnel with a light at the end
Or will darkness fill my soul with fear

Oh no, I see it coming
The end is getting closer for us all
There is no use denying
From any height we'll all soon fall

On we go
And on we go
How long
For how long we do not know
Till the end
Until the end
Darkness
When darkness is our only friend

[solo: Durfy]

Can't take any more, I just want to know
Will I die alone and in pain?
Or will I go on while my friends pass away
I think that would drive me insane
To be born to die is senseless to me
A logic that I cannot see
To know your existence is governed by time
Can drive you to insanity

[Repeat pre-chorus / chorus]

Living in this daydream
Wondering when it will end
Now I run away into the night
Can't escape my fears as they fill me with fright
I must accept the truth of how things are
And hope the cycle's end for me is still quite far

My mouth have drained the cup of immortality
Cursed is living among fleeting generations
Damned is lasting in the calm of anonymous grave
Formula of immortality placed by my side
Where are the mouths, which will vivify its substance
I'm waiting for the time
When my brothers find me
Bestial wings cut cold air
Courier of darkness flits to set fire
To hearts frozen by time
Extinguished before ages
Time of rebellion is coming
I'll lead my servants
I'll destroy the temples of false mysticism
No one will manage to see the
White hand of death

Watching in darkness

Riding on the wind

With rubble on the ground

With no flames glowing anywhere
I felt the cold instead
And it seems that my worst nightmare
Suddenly became reality
But this has gone beyond,
Far beyond imagination

I'm living next to the edge
Under radiating skies
Living close to the end
Of wonderland

Might be you simply went too far

Is beneath your dignity

You never even realised

The master of every thought
So you're playing like a God,
But who created

But within the grisly cavern, that horrid blackened tomb
Buried was the word unuttered, Sophia's fallen stone
Encircled by the Viper, who's secret is but its dread
For its venom is the elixir and the diamond is its egg

O terrible glamour! O alluring devilish fruit!
That has grown from the tree, which crown is its root
And sprung from Thine holy body, and watered by Thine holy blood
That we all might become as foolish as the gods

How did it come to pass
That the moon rose from the Sea?
And Death dressed itself as a beauteous bride
Who is paradox perfected
Curled in the greatest of mystery
As She's born into that which She defies

So I set to search upon the wildest of all trails
The old serpent's back, that leads to the Abysmal grail
Yet the riddle was cast between the without and the within
For where does the tail end and the hungering fangs begin?

One look at him would terrify, Black-Beard is what he became known as

He made himself look hellish
Framing his face in fire
By placing long lighted matches
Under his hat to strike fear in his prey

Heâd hide his ship and lay in waiting for some unsuspecting vessel
Heâd attack with such ferocity, No one ever acted so fiercely
He carried three bracers of pistols, had lots of rum for all his men
When things got slow heâd stir thing up, By shooting his guns in his dark cabin

They say he had fourteen wives
And a governorâs refuge
He came to shore quite often
He even once took the Kingâs pardon

He raped and murdered the innocent
He was the terror that sailed the sea
Along the mid-Atlantic coast
Black Beard brought horror and misery
So many met with a watery grave
So many ships fell by his hand
His pure brutality knew no bounds
The oceanâs devil and his evil band

He had taken such a toll upon the sea
All the people cried for something to be done
Then Virginias governor had had enough
He sent his own ship to capture him dead or alive

He raped and murdered the innocent
He was the terror that sailed the sea
Along the mid-Atlantic coast
Black Beard brought horror and misery
Then in the year 1718
On November twenty first
Near the Ocracoke Inlet
Twenty-five wounds ended his blood-thirst

Metal,Melvins,Mine Is No Disgrace,"How does it feel
To take the blame
How does it feel
To be behind the drain
Because you take what you can get and ask for more
You never get what you deserve
And thatâs the score
Remember that the life you save may be your own
But when youâre bankrupt you wont get another loan
I hope that youâll accept my sympathy
But understand I gotta think its better him than me
Itâs better him than me
A chain is just as strong as itâs weakest link
When you endure the strain itâs always later than you think
Itâs later than you think
Resign to a life of chronic cellibacy
With fond memories and cheap pornography
God forbid I ever wanted intimacy
No more, that out out of the door
God forbid I should feel
I know that ainât real
But now I feel like I could rape a nun
And itâs always the first kiss that gets you drunk
That gets you drunk
So I keep a habit on her face
While I listen to that Yes song
Yours is no disgrace
Mine is no disgrace
No, no disgrace
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
How does it feel
To fade away
How does it feel
To be beneath the train
The life diguised behind the backward mask
A little dignity is all I ask
Many people cross the beach and leave no trace
Well Iâm hoping for my footprints to remain
I know that ainât real
But now I feel like I could rape a nun
And itâs always the first kiss that gets you drunk
That gets you drunk
So I keep a habit on her face
While I listen to that Yes song
Yours is no disgrace
Mine is no disgrace
No, no disgrace
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Mine is no
Mine is no disgrace
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Mine is no
Mine is no disgrace...

Emptied of myself I fell to the ground

The night and brought strength I have never felt on my own 
And He held me up until I could walk again 
And promised to stay by my side forever

Soon he'll face truth
Over the hills

Dawn is near

I simply can't believe
Soldiers, soldiers, soldiers everywhere
As far as I can see
Billions of enemies
Bound to tear my world apart
Now that I face the facts
I gotta realize
Something must I have been wrong from the start
I can see

Metal,Acoustic Torment,The Narrow Gate,"The way you walk is broad and plain
From numerous fellows you let yourself float
But with every step you approach eternal pain
Cause hell waits at the end of the road

You despise the orders of the LORD
You want to enjoy your life
And ignore His Holy Word

Turn from your evil ways
Stay righteous in all pain and hate
Leave the road that leads to hell
And enter through the narrow gate

Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial
Because when he has stood the test
He will receive the crown of life
That GOD has promised to those who love Him

Turn from your evil ways
Stay righteous in all pain and hate
Leave the road that leads to hell
And enter through the narrow gate

Wide is the gate and broad is the road
That leads to destruction
And many enter through it
But small is the gate and narrow the road
That leads to life 
And only a few find it

Leave the road that leads to hell
And enter through the narrow gate
JESUS wants to be your saviour
Do not let Him wait

Do not let Him wait

That hardens in me

I'm wishing I could feel it but I know
I know it's bigger
'cause I know even though my pride's grown
I could fall
Take it through the eyes like men
You're scared of what could come

You can take yours

They wore the sun as their burning halo
Adorned in garments of the calm blue sky

Beyond creation
Above destruction

Until their arrival, I wondered alone
My fate drawn by hands holding flowers and stone
Dualistic mirrors
Self-dissecting

Repeat the cycle, rebuild the bone
Reunite with the hands holding flowers and stone

Flowers and blood
Stone and flesh
Flesh and blood

Your law will shelter the gifts of enchantment
But when the silhouettes of the icons appear

Metal,Zavorash,World Dominion,"[Text: T.Scorn, Music: Nil]

The masses of sleepers fear it in part on account of these historical examples
However in truth they most loath it in vain pride of these societal simples
The awakening is labeled the grinding of the edicational revolution
While those too far ahead now wait in boredom and seclusion
In turn we do possess time in ways unbestowed upon the primate races
We have the system to perfect our visions despite the enemies it faces
We are dead and we are shallow but in this age even their ""god"" loves us more
As those of the beyond always found this human rabble a total bore
Therefor, childer and wanna-bes, represent our civilization with pride
Now that even those that scorned us knows from whence their power is derived
For darkness stole all the wisdom from those who still cling to lore
Naming itself as craven as a means to win a greater war
""Yet know this humans of each pointless nation, the ancient covenant lies shattered as the deceitful prism before it, and each minute that passses means further withering of my kind's patience.
For upon being reborn we slowly do begin to remember the superior pleasures that truly is our birthright...
We see ourselves reduced to deveitful equality at the gain of lessers who'd hate us even if embraced - in the end merely another reason why this civilization might just be defaced...""
Failing to retort to our appreciate my wasted visions, I left humanity behind.
Making sure to bring along the powers and passions these sleepers would deem divine.

Metal,Dantesco,Burnt,"Here I stand in front of this cross
Haunting, the ghost in my mind
Living a hell, in the dungeons I'm cold
And a flame's burning my heart

The burning of the witches is close to begin
The judge made the fate of my soul
My skin and my eyes will suffer the pain
But the silence, my heart can't control

I fear the spirits of the dead
Could take my soul away
I'll raise my hands... a hopeless call

Lived in a dream of crystal tears
Now broken by the truth of yourself
Burnt by the cross, for the love of your god
The wings of your spirit are red

The way you betrayed our pact and our oath
And the way you can smile at my face
Consumed all my hopes, destroyed all my dreams
But my ashes will be washed by the rain

I fear the spirits of the dead
Could take my soul away
I'll raise my hands... a hopeless call

See my eyes... burned by the flames of this hell
Look at her eyes... damnation that will never end

Here I stand attached to this stake
Haunted, the ghost of my life
Lived in a hell in the forest, I'm dead
And the flames burned all my heart

The burning of the witches is close to an end
The town saw the fate of my soul
My skin and my eyes just suffered the pain
But in silence my heart had to hold

I fear the spirits of the dead
Could take my soul away
I'll raise my hands... a hopeless call

See my eyes... burned by the flames of this hell
Look at her eyes... damnation that will never end

Oh! God
How can I stand all her suffering caused by my faith?
My spirit at the end will taste a piece of hell
I will never rise... from hell!
Because of the love I betrayed
I am waiting my time

How can I stand all her suffering caused by my faith?
My spirit at the end will taste a piece of hell
Now my time has come

The tears of the heretics
Feed the winds of the tempest
Red, the darkness of the forest
Screaming slayer of silence

A fear that came from nowhere
Told by the crucified
And by your god all is over
For the victims of your lies

The cross... your cross... your damned cross!
Guilty of taking lives away, burned by the stake
They burn... in flames... they will burn
In the name of purity and faith

I feared the spirits of the dead
But now my soul is away
I opened my arms... at freedom's call

See my eyes... burned by the flames of this hell
Look at her eyes... damnation that will never end

Sometimes I had wondered if the best was yet to come
I can't deny it there are moments I regret
So much I'd do different if I could do it all again
I lost the world and I didn't find it until you found me
Gone but it came back in the wake of your smile
Now I am stronger growing the soul of a man
And I know my heart will never be alone again
I've got a life and nothing win make it go away
I guess we  glorified the world around us as we went along the way
One day reality was all there ever was
I ate and drank your beauty and breathed the air you had breathed
Then came the autumn and the winter like before
Dreamland turned to realland and we faced a new frontier
We lost the world
Sometimes we hold it but it's slipping) away
When we add reality it doesn't taste like our dream
Then there's too much sour loo much salt in our world
There's too many cooks to decide what two lovers shall eat
We're not alone
I know you know what I mean with these words now don't you
We're siamese children related by heart
And nothing can tear us apart
When we share the silence she knows what I'm saying
Words though unspoken are changing heart
Two-thousand days have now passed since
I met you and of so many only (four-houndred alone
Then we were joined by a fusion of my eyes and the face of  an angel
It reminds me of her
With you around all the day are worth living and when we add reality now we're still standing strong

The crestfallen amaranth torn into thousands of shreds

When seen through tears
I am the cemetery

Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust
The skies cannot be reached from six feet under

Something else shines inside of me

Down this darkened path I choose to live

My heart has turned to stone

Will you guide me?

As I look to what you have to give

Or will I go alone


Frustration, temptation grows

Reflection, deception shows


Walking down this path of hell

As I dream of heaven

Wallowing in self despair

My life clock is at eleven


Desolation, devastation

Take what's left of me

Separation, isolation

Reel in mystery


Can't believe what has become of my life

Someone tell me when will

I see an end to the torment?

Watching as the hope fades out of my eyes

I can feel it fading

Someone find and end to this evil

Symphony in my mind


Torn apart and left for dead

Slowly feel the anger overtake me

Things you've done and things you've said

I have never thought that you'd forsake me


Look into the dark of night

Vengeful heart so full of spite

Tear my heart out while it's bleeding

Inside of me


Keeping my eyes on the prize

Rest assured I will arise

I spread my wings and I will fly

And by my hand you'l surely die

[Well, you probably didn't imagine that when humans start to dream, the adventures, the great fantasies, that they experienced are caused and controlled by their assigned twin spirit. This Twin Spirit is a sort of guide created to handle the dremaers minds, making them live what they dream as if it was true. But, under normal circumstances they shouldn't see him and they shouldn't even know about his existence. When created, to be admitted, the twin spirits knock at the gates of the Dreams kingdom with a particular beat sequence that works as a password. Causally, the Genius clock alarm beated exactly the same sequence, and, being a drummer himself, he started to imagine in his mind a snare drum pattern that followed that beat. He was not completely awaken and the snare beats he was imaging of reached the dream kingdom gate, and he was wrongly admittend in that parallel dimension by the doorkeepers considered as a regular Twin Spirit ! ]

[Storyteller]
The two brand new friends found themselves in a very long and funny coloured train where the twin spirits grouped in pairs, were sitting. The train started unexpectedly its race and immediately reached an incredible speed !Infatc, after some minutes, the train eventually reached its final destination. The Twin Spirit Land. The Stationmaster was an old man that since the birth of time has always greeted the new twin spirits at their arrival to the land]"

And I guess she had a lot of money or something, cause she was constantly buying him clothes and getting him lots of stuff and loading him with money, you know?
He was constantly going to the coffee shop always getting the best herb and the best hash, you know?
He was in good shape. She was really good looking, she was really cool.
I, I don't think he'd ever met her before but she had, you know, other boyfriends I suppose.
So I'm sitting on the couch, you know, in Toss's apartment and I'm reading, you know, Maximum Rock and Roll or Flip Side, one of those punk things.
And I heard Skeeter come in, and he came in and he had all these really nice clothes on, she bought him all this stuff. She like bought him cologne, he was really really smelling good, you know? He looked good too.
You know he came in and put his herb on the table and, whatever. I'm just reading my little punk magazine, not really paying attention.
And then he says, uh, he says ""Hey Dave"", and I look up and he's standing there with his dick in his hand and he's kinda got it like lifted up so he's looking at the head of his dick.
He kinda pointed it at me, I didn't know what to think. He said ""does that look like pus to you?""

Stand proud and show them all that we will not give in

We'll fight with all our hearts, the power lives within

Out of the shadows of night we will rise unleashing the power foretold
The power and valor lives on in our hearts and with it we'll never grow old.
With fists held high we'll lead the fight
And crush them all with our never ending might!

Scream loud let your voice be heard, let the whole world hear your cry
A monstrous shout that echoes well into the night

Drowning in my liquid dreams


Looking back I'm paralyzed

The dreaded memories inside

Agony corroding me

Keeping me from destiny

The tragedy the suffering

Deafened by the silent screams

Never more to hear them roar

Never more to be ignored


I'm craving feeding lost

I'm empty bleeding falling


Disdain is my outlook as well as my plan

Compelled to incarnate from spirit to man

He who controls me controls my lost fate

I re-live his torment and wait at his gate

Cast off warnings of fate decree

Glory is crimson my soul is set free


Gravity failing me see it all as I fall

Falling down through the ground

Bridges burned lessons learned


Who will be there for me

All is lost at what cost

Misery endlessly twice the pain who will reign


Redemption is all I seek

Free me from my suffering

Sanctuary's calling me

Away from infinity

Burning all the garbage in the 'ol oil drum
Curlers kettles cans and curtains
They're so hurtin' she so sore
Eye dropper crack hits every mornin'
It's almost noon she has got to score

White trash momma

Raised on white bread
Trading stepped-on crack for bad head
Notice as the tracks are revealed
Her white trash fate is sealed

They didn't even see the twister comin'
The wind just whipped right out of the sky
Mom was too busy cookin'...
Mom was too busy gettin' high...
Carry...mommy...

Let's gather 'round the 'ol oil drum
It's right down by the shore...
We'll be talkin' and trading stories
'bout a white trash whore

My throat filled with blood
I can still say your name
And still call for The Flood

We are fighting so obscure
Beneath the lonely moonlight
And the street calls our name
Repeatedly tonight

Our thoughts are plastered
On the miserable walls
Of this lowering bud
This Monster of a city

I wish our words
Were of any use
I wish we could reach out
Before they shut our mouths

We have no friends
We have no lovers
We're facing dead ends
It's for the better
You don't wanna join us
We're headed in a wall
With our eyes wide shut
And our faith on stall

But the pavement has worn us
Down to th' essentials
Out of strength we howl
Starving hysterical naked

You take me you feel me coming on

Now you want to take me for everything I am
Gotta word that's coming up coming up my throat.
It's a long ass word, gonna make me choke.
I like to hold my pride
Right in between my hands.
So I can feel it hang.

[We Reach]

I could have hoped for a better piece of your man.
Better times I wrote for glass, less, wind.
From both behinds in back, we're reaching one of each, in time.
Heart like a picture to be.
Hardly, we reach.

Shove them into dark corners
Feed them the leftovers of dogs
Dig up their graves and laugh
Pick your teeth with their bones

To walk a trail of tears
Forced by our forefathers
To watch their wives and children die

Metal,Dance Club Massacre,"Who Are You, And What Have You Done With Six","In the wonder years I was in my own domain.

Thrashing to Phil, and Mustaine.

Then I picked up a CD with a pair of breasts wrapped in barbed wire.

This day will go down in infamy.

There was no dress code.

No clique to separate the men, women, and children.

My own kind of club.

Good times and great memories like the classic cabana.

The wine was fine and the trumpets ranged.

And upon rekindling this deathly siege things weren't exactly the same.

Now I travel apart of the team.

The teams been sold to the Devil himself.

You'd think he would know what to do, the anthems devoted to his dynasty are portrayed yet sabotaged.

Who's got the time for team spirit nowadays?

I don't feel quite at home.

I'm brand new.

This isn't where I thought I was going.

This place is not the same as I left it.

The old me would kick the new me's ass if he wasn't shorter.

What's with the new style?

Where were the chicks when I was dope?

But I guess it's OK.

Like Ben said, 200 solemn faces are you.

And underground I feel cool in my youth, which by the way has passed, but I'm still cool.

Check me out, I'm rocking the house.

I'd hope Dimmu would be proud.

And underground I feel cool in my youth, which by the way has passed, but I'm still cool.

How can you believe in or trust it?
This system's proofed that it's absurd 
Setting signs
he tried to wake them up,
open up their eyes. 
But they don't listened
They were all too busy.
Facing just the end of the day.
Never thought of tomorrow. 
Yes, I know. More you'll ever will
Maybe I scare you. I reflect what scared me
Why do you all baffle my warning?
You'd better let this in your life! 
Prosecution
for he'd disturbed their dreams,
distorting his speech 
Being here on his own,
with that vision he had seen
Yes, I know (he must be) out of mind
in another mental sphere 
Setting signs

open up their eyes. 
But they don't listened

How you hurt her, went so far beyond the wrong I'll burn you down to cinders, ashes now you're gone
And the scars you left behind slowly fade away with time
Ashes of what used to be now they tore you on to me

Begging mercy, shifting, playing on both sides cut your own throat open and ask me how you died
What was once respect has slowly headed south memory forces echoes better in my mouth
And the scars you left behind slowly fade away with time
Ashes of what used to be now they tore you on to me

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust

Well, I have no respect left for what you're about and sympathy won't come from me
Erase everything that you once could have been destruction of your dignity
I scatter your ashes into the wind regret is too short, now you're free
Leave here in shame doomed to fulfil your pathetic destiny
And the scars you left behind slowly fade away with time
Ashes of what used to be now they tore you on to me

It was the time we cried for justice loud
We did and felt so proud
Then they start to cut the moral out
Allright, we have allowed
And they start to sort the people out
We looked away and had no doubt 
See, when he first came it looked like a sign
He promised to save us from crime
So we thought everything would be fine
And he heals all our wounds - but... 
Then he starts saying
doubters are waiting 
He talked about
the only one
he had become
the only thing
that we could win
and pray to him - so pray to him 
And it seems to be
that hear now, fear now
We, we didn't see
the tears now, tears now
And could it really be that we
we're never free or meant to be - see 
We called him healer, see what we got
We were believers, see what we got 
And now we cry for freedom loud
They laugh and felt so proud
Then we tried to turn the wheel around
Too late, we're not allowed 
See, when he first came it looked like a sign

He heals all our wounds - but...

Metal,Dance Club Massacre,Brewtality,"I'd like to propose another toast for the gents and gentiles.

Yes we swallow, regurgitate, high five, but from our troughs comes enlightenment for at least 5 and a half hours.

4 with the hour of power.

They say the sheep have been abandoned by their shepherd.   

It was the wolves that took him.

In packs of 6, 12, maybe 30.

No chance of retaining his field.

Pity for who?   The flock or the victim?

With this a new world order is upon us.   

To prepare, they will fight for president, vice, and so forth to the route in which assholes are doomed.

Pick up the pace, refill the glass.

The stakes get higher as the population grows.

And soon this world will be spinning faster than you can cope with.

The sinners sway from side to side with no remorse.

The virgins marry us with pride in the disco room, be cool.

Now bestowed amongst kings and queens, much like in Roman times, the gladiators gather around a circle of death.

Choose each tactic wisely baby.

You don't want to go down in flames.

With balance and precision you could stay on top of the can.   

One fatal move and you're history.

You're just a cower who(ve never reached

anything, ever.

You are running, you are decided

To die anyway, life is just a pain.

You don't wanna suffer yourself anymore

The only what you got in your head is a suicide

Melancholy pessimism.

Your neck is clenching.

You're pulling up or sleeve

It take just a second

Jugulating your veins

Falling into agony

Can't feel your dripping blood

You will never live through it

what is a depressive feeling

Melancholy pessimism.

Corazon?
Por que no te logra morfeo
Acariciar?
Son sanguijuelas saciadas de tu
Temor
Deseo de que la noche no vuelva
Jamas

Un abismo
Esa la oscuridad

Tu lecho parece estar cubierto de
Espinas
-En la noche-
Un pano en tu rostro que no te deja
Respirar
-Por la noche-
Hipnos no llega...mas los ostros
Hijos de nicta
-Es la noche-
Hemera se esconde y tanato te
Viene a buscar
-Esta noche-

Los visitantes nocturnos
Te vienen a enloquecer
Con las torturas de su mundo
Hasta que llegue el amanecer

Victima de los demonios
Que salen a festijar
Tu habitacion, el manicomio
Donde la luz es sanidad

Y no logras encontrar la
Salida
Al eden...de la claridad

Y no puedes sanar tus heridas
Del punla de la oscuridad

Oh! Como siento morir entre
Tinieblas
-En la noche-
Ruego a todo los dioses que
El dia llegue ya!
-No la noche-
De la penumbra demonios, que
Me contemplan
-Esta noche-
Se burlan, ya que aunque
Amanezca...ellos volveran!
-Por la noche-

Metal,Abiura,What I_Ll Never See,"The circle is complete
The serpent bites its tail
Fluid images of infinity
Unknown words without a sound
My eyes,they seem to see
Their chests bleeding, their screams
Fragments of eternity
Once the lie, twice the alibi

Magnetization, neverending vortex
Back to the source of our disease
Whirlpool of colours, blood stained blankets
I'm just the painter of their agonies
Inside the chaos harmony
I'll learn the hidden secrets
Mine is the task to initiate
'cause I'm the chosen one
The only one

Like a photogram
A sharp image
I'm gonna show you
The step beyond this world
The no return
They all get rid of me
But I'm I the insane?
I'm the one who knows
The Everlasting one

Guilty for a crime undone
I've been left alone
Begging for the truth
Buried deep inside in all of us
Oh, please,remember my name
And don't forget my words
Oh no, please no!
I shall dance with knowledge, my bride
We'll die in our embrace
Our last embrace

Now I can close my eyes
Now I can close my eyes to die
And see what I've never seen
And see what I'll never see, never!

Full of pain of misunderstanding -
Which I like to be part of very often
Sometimes We look for the art.
In chosen creatures
So faithful to everything
Except the Planet's idea
So we decide to hide forever
Called Damnable by freedom
We were freedom,
We are freedom and
We will be free!
Although we know it is no way to run away
Then we would be definite
For all without any exception
And we would still have the sanity of living forever

Your mind from the truth

The system has made a virtual cage, the world

Turns into an abstract age

Manipulated imitations from hell

Quickly they did learn the folly of their ways

Metal,Damnation,Azarath (Watching In Darkness),"[lyrics: Les]

I'm one of them
My mouth have drained the cup of immortality
Cursed is living among fleeting generations
Damned is lasting in the calm of anonymous grave
Formula of immortality placed by my side
Where are the mouths, which will vivify its substance
I'm waiting for the time
When my brothers find me
Bestial wings cut cold air
Courier of darkness flits to set fire
To hearts frozen by time
Extinguished before ages
Time of rebellion is coming
I'll lead my servants
I'll destroy the temples of false mysticism
No one will manage to see the
White hand of death
My name is Azarath
Watching in darkness

Metal,Melbaculp,Never Surrender,"[Written by Jack McConnell]

Binded in life
But I won't give up the fight urgency strong
But I, I'll never belong
Tempted with greed
False prosperity
Slave to their system
I
Will be freed
We will fight against all the empires
We will win or else we
Will die
We will fight to carry our creed to do whatever,
It is we please
Drowning in their wasteland
Can't call this home
I am so different
And
Different, is what they'll be shown
Never will I
Abandon these dreams
Never will I
Work the dead end beat
We will fight against all the empires

We will win or else we will die
We will fight to carry our creed to do
Whatever, it is we please
We will fight against all the empires
We will
Win or else we will die
We will fight to carry our creed
To do whatever,
It is we please
Down on their knees I chose to be free, yeah

the car is parked and the mood is sinking, 

so we'll take things slow. 

soon enough i will indulge myself.

Metal,Meliah Rage,Solitary Solitude,"Sequestered, secluded
Locked up, shackled, chained
He's ruled insane
Madman - killing any woman, child, man
Maniac - crazed by the pain in his brain
Madness - ceased by a shot to his vein

Solitary solitude
He's isolated in fear
Solitary solitude
Your isolated nightmare

Like Manson, like Bundy
A sick lust to end humanity
Malevolent - evil-minded molester of chastity
Savagery - morbid venomous dead brutality
Infernal - ruthless retched sleaze no sanity

Solitary solitude
He's isolated in fear
Solitary solitude
Your isolated nightmare

No doors plainted walls all he sees
Named aberrant, neurotic and diseased
Outcast devil
Deranged and malign
Sickened repetition
Focus in his mind
Abnormality, ferality
Not of the earth to be
Vitality, stability
His insincerity now
Electrocution persecution
Shock treatment today
Ten thousand bolts ten thousand volts
See his brain decay
Vested now, shredded
His life begins to fade
Desolating excruciating
Pain of life it drains from him

Dancing on, the wisdom of ancient graves! Transient molecule's importance is ignored. Shallow and empty, the entertained worthless horde! Values misplaced, our pineal eye is erased. We're shackled in, the de-evolution to be! Gleaming lights of choking smoke. Increasingly plagued with no hope. The fall of an empire, makes way for another... and the cycle repeats, it perpetuates. We are slowly extinguished, in horrific demise. Our quantum essence, it fails to align. Gleaming lights of choking smoke. Increasingly plagued with no hope.

Heaven, it seems so close when you're by my side
When we're together it's paradise
There's nothing in this world that brings me greater joy
As when I look into your eyes

I never wanted anyone so much before

I call you up just so I could hear your voice
Your laughter is music to my ears
Your gentle touch sends shivers down my spine
My passion soars when you are near

My love for you grows stronger day by day
My heart belongs to you, believe me when I say

My life means nothing without you
I feel such joy when we're together
With all my heart I cherish you
I want to make you mine forever my love

To kiss your tender lips and feel your warm embrace
When you're upset, to make you smile
To whisper in your ear and take you by the hand
I'd travel for one million miles

The thought of losing you is just too much to bear
Just hear these words and you will see how much I care

My life means nothing without you
I feel such joy when we're together
With all my heart I cherish you
I want to make you mine forever my love

With all the dreams that never ever come true?
How could I believe they come true?
How long should I wait without you?

Still feeling close behind my face
The ebbing moments since our last embrace
I can't recall all the days they simply drift on by
But all the dreams that never ever come true?
How could I believe they come true?
How long should I wait without you?

Your shape is foil as if I am passing right
Through your arms I reach them again
Will I only catch a reflection of you?
Until I finally drown in you

Your shape is foil as if I am passing right
Through your arms I reach them again
Will I only catch a reflection of you?
Until I finally drown in you

Metal,Zandelle,Queen Anne S Revenge,"He terrorized the eastern waters for three dreadful years
His savagery is legendary, His name has lived on through the ages
Born in the end of the 1600s, his given name was Edward
One look at him would terrify, Black-Beard is what he became known as

He made himself look hellish
Framing his face in fire
By placing long lighted matches
Under his hat to strike fear in his prey

Heâd hide his ship and lay in waiting for some unsuspecting vessel
Heâd attack with such ferocity, No one ever acted so fiercely
He carried three bracers of pistols, had lots of rum for all his men
When things got slow heâd stir thing up, By shooting his guns in his dark cabin

They say he had fourteen wives
And a governorâs refuge
He came to shore quite often
He even once took the Kingâs pardon

He raped and murdered the innocent
He was the terror that sailed the sea
Along the mid-Atlantic coast
Black Beard brought horror and misery
So many met with a watery grave
So many ships fell by his hand
His pure brutality knew no bounds
The oceanâs devil and his evil band

He had taken such a toll upon the sea
All the people cried for something to be done
Then Virginias governor had had enough
He sent his own ship to capture him dead or alive

He raped and murdered the innocent
He was the terror that sailed the sea
Along the mid-Atlantic coast
Black Beard brought horror and misery
Then in the year 1718
On November twenty first
Near the Ocracoke Inlet
Twenty-five wounds ended his blood-thirst

Metal,Zandelle,Broken Trust,"I opened up to you, brought you into my world and asked for nothing in return

I shared that was mine, you were like family, I never thought I would get burned by you

The shock was harrowing, traumatic, unforeseen, was not prepared for your attack

Despair took hold of me, wallowed in misery, felt like a dagger in the back


Now, my view of life is grim, my cynical distrust, the only thing that I hold dear

You, have made me what I am, a skeptic to the core, I question everything I hear


I am stronger now and my jaded skin cannot be pierced by cruel intentions

I will not be fooled, no not anymore by cunning lies of false affections


Time, it took away the pain but memories remain reminding me to guard my trust

I, have found my inner strength, conviction taking hold now I will do what I must


I am standing tall, I will face it all, none will keep me from my glory

They will know my name, they will cry in pain if they dare to stand before me


I saw the warning signs but I ignored

The subtle hints that seem so clear with hind-sight

Never again will I be fooled by you

Never again will I just play the fool

No not ever again


My mind is made up now, I'm coming after you, I will take pleasure in your doom

I am relentless now, fully unstoppable, revenge shall be my driving fuel

The visions in my brain of you in utter pain, bring forth a new-found happiness

I'll see them all come true, you dim misguided fool, and I'll rejoice in your distress


I will watch you fall and laugh through it all, I will cherish every second

All the agony that you'll get from me, power that you never reckoned


I've learned from my mistakes and I've grown strong

With head held high I will bask the power

My conscience is clean I know I'm in the right

You'll never see me back down from a fight

No not ever again


Never!

The riddle still unsolved, smoke rings subside
Untied, unravelled, unthought, unsaid

His shoes are desterted, the box is all alone

Waiting for a train
To take you away from here

Beside you
On the platform
You decided to go on your way

Silent breeze of a memory makes it colder

Where have you been sweet child of mine?
I've cried so many tears knowing you suffer
No matter what you've done
All this time I wanted to tell you
You're welcome home

I'm still here
To hold you near
To let you heal through my wounds

As our hunger calls

We will seek out our prize

Through the night hunt our prey

Then we hide

In shadows throughout the day


Forever immortal

Ancient power

We never age

Filled with strength

We'll devour


Many hate our kind

They are filled with repulsion

Try to hunt us down

Genocide their compulsion

On their blood we will feast

Soon they'll learn the nature of the beast


Forever immortal

Ancient power

We never age

Filled with strength

We'll devour


Persecuted for what we are

Forced into a life oh hiding

Godless creatures with no souls

Offending their pure hearts


We are stronger by far

And have the cunning of the ages

Their minds we can control

And seduce their hearts

Blood is the life, with it we thrive

Passage of time only makes us stronger

And yet despite all of our might

In shadows we must hide

And it was in the cold of night
I dreamt of a day
I'd be released from this hell
Forgiven...

I think that I've been there in my dreams before
I know that in life it set me free

And I'll keep holding on

Get me out of this hell
I spent too long dying in this prison cell
Will you set me free?
Release the pain of life from me

Tell me what u see
This old tired man is what's left of me
Would you set it free?
The only thing left, the hope in me

Hope never dies

Can I be condemned for life
For my mistakes?
You know I regret what I have done
Can I seek forgiveness in my sour?
To set me free
Set me free

Metal,Zandelle,Eradicated Existence,"Another envelope is waiting for him

Another task that he must carry out

He can't delay, he must be on his way

He gathers up the tools of his trade


Black clothes

Black gloves

Black boots

His guns


He's now on the hunt, seeking out his target

Like so many other times before

Package he received contains all information

That he'll need and nothing more


Into the night, into the shadows, making his way once again

Repeating steps all too familiar, he is the master of his trade


Soon he finds his mark, maps out the location

Planning his escape when the task is done

Then he bides his time for the perfect moment

Taking comfort as he feels the handle of his gun


Making his move, toward the target

Then in a flash, draws his gun

Quickly takes aim and pulls the trigger

Hitting the mark, the task is done


Blood splatters everywhere

The target hits the floor

As the commotion starts

He is out the door


Back to his home he then returns

Sends off a note to say it's done

Then in a day her receives his payment

He then waits for his next one


Life was not always

The way that it is now

Much lead him to this point

Here is why and how


When he was young he had a home and parents who did love him

A happy childhood same as anybody else

Then misfortunes struck

Both his parents gone


The news hit hard

is world was torn apart

In just a flash

He lost all he had ever know


He was put into foster care and given to one couple

The system did not know the misery he'd face

Beating everyday

Treated like a slave


They belittled him, they mistreated him, made his life a living hell

They were pitiless, they were merciless, deep into despair he fell

They abandoned him, they neglected him, they were heartless, they were cruel

Filled with misery, living agony, wretchedness his only school


As the years went by

Resentment filled his soul

The streets became his second home

And payback his only goal


They belittled him, they mistreated him but now things had changed

He was pitiless, he was merciless, blew them both away

They had been his first, it had been the worst thing he'd ever done

But he felt redeemed, his slate then then was clean, he found purpose in a gun


As he sits there in the darkness waiting for his payment to arrive

Something starts to feel peculiar something is not quite right

His phone begins to ring confirming his suspicions

His contact on the line tells him they have to meet right now


Years of wisdom scream deception as he ponders what to do

He knows that he must get closer if he hopes to learn the truth

What caused this sudden change? Why is he now the target?

It all seems very strange, he goes to face his fate right now


Instantly he faced the one who they had sent to take him out

But surprise was now on his side, his success was not in doubt

His assassin lay there bleeding, he continued on his way

He would find his ex-employers and then he would make them pay


Soon he found them the ones who he sought

Looks of disbelief on their faces

In that moment his world  fell apart

They revealed the truth of his past

He'd been working for the government ( a secret covert branch)

Who killed those that spoke out against them

All this time he thought that his job

Was to take out the scum of the earth

When in fact he killed innocents

For those he felt harbored no worth


And to make matters worse

They revealed to him

His parents died by their hands

Never had he ever felt so grim


Then they died

He killed them all

On the hunt

The rest would fall

In bereavement of immemorial falsehood, our heinous breed is revealed

Every feasibility of hiding vanquished, wheedling and detraction exposed
As I heaved these shackles of mine, then cured the ailment of all times
In chimerical fraternisation, in lewd horrendous crimes
They ordain the chronic miserliness, shibboleths of pure rhymes
Seen as an impious urchin, I shalt never be lionised
Displaying the cleavage of benignity, premier in the ordinal of lies

Lingering immolation
Elucidation of complete void
Arterial dissimulation
All in modesty foiled

Clandestine yet flagrant, man locked in gullibility
Earthbound. Universal, the thought killed in conformity
The premonitions are grizzled, in luscious hope forlorn
In vagrancy voluminous, all truth becomes torn

Defending the presbytery of devolution, militating for a cause
Icebound in shining fiction, a path of endless loss
A malinger they made me, opprobrious they remain
Yet I have their jewel shattered, hence it is all the same

Though still I dream...

Lingering desecration
Upon all I wish in the end
